# JCTsh DEVLOG

## 2026-05-16
Restructured Salt Sensor project into JCTsh smart home monorepo. Salt Sensor
becomes first component under jctsh/components/. Centralized Python log server
added to jctsh/core/logging/, served at http://raspberrypi.local/. ESP web server
removed; log messages now published via MQTT to jctsh/sensors/salt-sensor/log.
MQTT topics renamed from saltlevel/* to jctsh/sensors/salt-sensor/*. Node-RED
flow split into core.flow.json (broker) and salt-sensor.flow.json (sensor logic).
Test mode loop bug fixed — test sequence now runs once through WARNING then CRITICAL
instead of cycling indefinitely.
