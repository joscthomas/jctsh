## Backlog

### CARD-034 · [idea] [personal] Complete digital-identity-protection-checklist.md
**Notes:** Work through `digital-identity-protection-checklist.md` (repo root) — Joseph and Robin's personal security checklist closing single-point-of-failure risks (carrier port-out PIN, 2FA off SMS, credit freezes, password manager, household verification protocol, incident response plan). Almost entirely manual actions by Joseph/Robin themselves (phone calls to carriers/bureaus, account settings changes) — not something Claude Code can execute directly, but worth tracking to completion since it's currently all unchecked. Also has an "Open Items to Fill In" section (list specific banks/brokerages in use, confirm current password manager/2FA setup, set a 6-month review date) that needs input from Joseph before those parts can be finished.

### CARD-031 · [bug] [p-w-firefly] Fix coachproxyos heartbeat's same publish/disconnect race condition
**Notes:** While debugging false "photo-server silent for 35 minutes" watchdog alerts (2026-07-06), found the root cause: `photo-server-heartbeat.py` published its `/log` and `/heartbeat` MQTT messages (QoS 1) back-to-back then called `client.disconnect()` immediately without running the network loop — occasionally the second publish's packet hadn't fully flushed before the socket closed, silently dropping the `/heartbeat` message while `/log` (published first) always got through. Fixed in photo-server's script via `client.loop_start()` + `wait_for_publish(timeout=5)` on both messages before `loop_stop()`/`disconnect()`. See `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md` for full root-cause writeup.

`components/p-w-firefly/jctsh-heartbeat.py` (coachproxyos, the RV Pi) uses the identical publish-then-disconnect pattern and almost certainly has the same latent bug — just less noticeable since a stray "coachproxyos silent" alert is easy to dismiss for a device that's expected to roam in and out of Tailscale range. Apply the same fix: `loop_start()` → publish both → `wait_for_publish()` on both → `loop_stop()` → `disconnect()`.

**Blocked:** RV Pi wasn't reachable (Tailscale down / not home) when this was found — deploy next time `coachproxyos` is reachable at `100.90.246.43` or `192.168.1.219`.

### CARD-030 · [bug] [photo-server] Re-enable weekly backup cron once Takeout zips are cleared
**Notes:** During the Google Takeout migration (2026-07-04/05), `/mnt/photo-library` filled to 100% because raw Takeout zips (817GB combined for Joseph + Robin) and Immich's own growing asset storage were competing for the same 916GB drive. Fixed by relocating the zips off that drive: ~450GB (9 of Joseph's 12 zips) moved to `/mnt/photo-library-backup` (Momentus 640GB drive), remaining ~366GB (3 Joseph zips + all of Robin's) moved to the NVMe root (`/home/jct/takeout-staging/`).

The weekly rsync backup cron (`photo-library-backup.sh`, Sundays 2am) was **disabled** (commented out in crontab, prefixed `#DISABLED-during-migration#`) because it already ran once mid-migration and mirrored 200GB of the transient zip staging onto Momentus via `rsync --delete` — pointless and wasteful, and worse, leaving it enabled while zips sit on Momentus risks the *next* run deleting those same zips (since `--delete` makes the destination match the source, and the zips no longer exist in `/mnt/photo-library`, their only copy would be on Momentus with nothing "keeping" them from an rsync perspective if the backup script's source/dest were ever pointed there — verify actual risk before relying on this reasoning if the script changes).

Joseph wants to keep the zip files around for a while after migration completes, to spot-check the import without needing to re-download from Google. Momentus is only 640GB total and needs ~650-700GB free to hold the eventual full-library backup — it cannot hold both the zips *and* a real backup at the same time.

**Do this once Joseph confirms the import is verified and he's ready to delete the zips:**
1. Delete the zip files from both `/mnt/photo-library-backup/takeout-staging/` and `/home/jct/takeout-staging/`
2. Re-enable the cron job: `crontab -l | sed 's/^#DISABLED-during-migration# //' | crontab -`
3. Confirm it re-appears uncommented: `crontab -l`
4. Optionally trigger one manual run (`/usr/local/bin/photo-library-backup.sh`) to confirm the real library now backs up cleanly to Momentus with room to spare

### CARD-028 · [idea] [photo-server] Automated post-import quality scan (blur/duplicate detection)
**Notes:** Decided during photo-server migration (2026-07-04) to skip a manual pre-import quality pass entirely — importing everything as-is and relying on Immich's built-in duplicate detection (CLIP-embedding-based visual similarity, not just byte-hash) plus an ongoing "favorites" curation habit over time. This card captures the option to add an *automated* (no manual photo review) quality pass later, run after the Immich import so you can see real results first before deciding if it's worth doing.

**Tools considered (all scriptable, no manual visual review required):**
- **czkawka** — free, open source (Rust), finds exact + visually-similar duplicates, plus blurry/broken images; has a CLI, could run directly on the M8 against the Immich library folder
- **imagededup** (Python, by Idealo) — perceptual-hash + CNN-based near-duplicate detection, scriptable
- **fdupes** / **rdfind** — simple exact-byte-duplicate finders (fast, catches literal copies only, not near-duplicates)
- **DIY blur-score script** — e.g. OpenCV Laplacian-variance blur detection, a small Python script with a numeric threshold; could be built on request, nothing off-the-shelf needed
- (Commercial alternatives exist — Aftershoot, Narrative Select — but are built for photographers culling shoots, overkill for a one-time family library pass)

**CLIP note:** Immich's own duplicate detection and smart search are both powered by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, OpenAI) — specifically `ViT-B-32__openai` on this install. Duplicate detection compares visual embeddings (catches near-duplicates like burst shots), not just identical files, and never auto-deletes — it surfaces candidates in a "Duplicates" review screen for manual confirm.

**Important constraint:** any of these tools can run and *report* findings anytime, including post-import, directly against files on disk. But once Immich owns the library, actually *deleting/archiving* anything found must go through Immich itself (its UI/API) — not direct filesystem deletion — since Immich tracks every asset in its Postgres DB and a raw file delete would desync the DB (broken thumbnails, orphaned references). Ties into the planned deletion-logging system (photo-server Step 14).

**Sequencing:** wait until after Joseph's (and later Robin's) Immich import completes and ML processing (duplicate detection, facial recognition) has run. See what Immich's own built-in detection surfaces first, then decide whether an additional automated tool is worth adding.

### CARD-027 · [idea] [hiking-sensor] GPIO-controlled power gating for I2C peripherals during sleep
**Notes:** Observed 2026-07-03: after putting the device to sleep (display correctly shows "Hiking monitor asleep"), the ESP32's and LTR-390's onboard power-indicator LEDs stayed lit. These are hardwired to their respective 3.3V rails, not GPIO-controlled — ESP32 deep sleep only stops the CPU from executing, it does not cut power to anything downstream. Since `VOUT+` runs directly to ESP32 `VIN` (switch not in the power path) and nothing gates the I2C peripherals' power, BME280 and LTR-390 stay fully powered and drawing their own operating current for the entire "sleep" duration, in addition to the boost module's own quiescent draw (see CARD-026).

**Idea:** add a small P-FET (or similar high-side load switch) on the 3.3V rail feeding BME280 + LTR-390 (and possibly the e-ink display), gated by a spare GPIO, so the firmware can fully cut peripheral power during deep sleep and re-enable it on wake. Would reduce real standby current beyond what CARD-026 measures for the current design.

**Sequencing:** do CARD-026 (measure actual sleep current) first — if the measured number is already acceptable for realistic storage durations, this added complexity may not be worth it. Only pursue if CARD-026 reveals standby drain is a real problem.

**What a P-FET is (for later reference):** a P-channel Field-Effect Transistor — a transistor that acts as a switch, well-suited to sit on the *positive* supply line and turn power on/off to something downstream (a "high-side switch"). The GPIO does not carry power to the rail itself — it only controls the P-FET's gate (a control signal, negligible current). The actual power path is the P-FET's own source-to-drain channel, wired in-line on the 3.3V rail between the supply and the sensors:

```
3.3V rail ──► P-FET source ──► P-FET drain ──► Sensors (BME280, LTR-390)
                      │
GPIO pin ─────────────┘ (controls the gate only)
```

GPIO pulls the gate low (relative to source) → P-FET turns on → 3.3V flows through to the sensors. GPIO drives the gate high (same as source) → P-FET turns off → sensors disconnected, no power reaches them. P-FET specifically (not the more common N-FET) because P-FETs turn on with the gate pulled low relative to source, which is the natural way to switch a high-side/positive-rail connection with a simple GPIO pin; N-FETs are easier to use on the low side (switching the ground return), which doesn't fit well here since you generally don't want to float the ground of a shared I2C bus. Practically: one small transistor (a few cents) plus maybe a resistor.

**Where exactly to place it:** confirmed via `wiring.md` — the TP4056+boost module's 5.7V output feeds the ESP32's `VIN` pin, and the ESP32 dev board's own onboard regulator steps that down to 3.3V, exposed on its `3.3V` pin. That `3.3V` pin (not the boost module's output directly) is the actual source of the rail feeding BME280, LTR-390, and the e-ink display today. The P-FET must go **between the ESP32's `3.3V` pin and the sensors** — not between the boost module and the ESP32's `VIN`. Gating the boost-to-`VIN` connection instead would cut power to the ESP32 itself, which can't work, since the ESP32 needs to stay powered and running in order to control the gate signal in the first place. Gating only the downstream sensor branch keeps the ESP32 awake and in control throughout, switching off only the sensors.

**Standards cross-reference:** logged as a candidate pattern in `JCTsh-Build-Standards.md` §2.14 point 8 (v1.11) — flagged `[CANDIDATE — not yet required, pending validation]`, not a mandatory requirement yet. Once this card is built and measured, promote §2.14 point 8 to a real required numbered standard if it proves worthwhile.

### CARD-025 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Test retired LiPo battery — good or bad?
**Notes:** The hiking-monitor's original LiPo battery failed in the field (2026-07-03) with no advance warning and was replaced from spare stock (2 EEMB 603449 cells remain in Bag 7). Before permanently retiring/recycling the original cell, run this test to determine whether it's actually damaged or just tripped its built-in PCM protection circuit (which would reset after a proper recharge).

**Tier 1 — recharge-and-rest check:**
1. Place the cell in a fireproof/non-flammable spot (LiPo charging bag once purchased — see JCTsh-Build-Standards.md §2.14 — or a ceramic plate/metal tray in the meantime).
2. Connect to a TP4056 module and charge for 30-60 minutes. Watch for the charge-complete LED signal. **Stop immediately if any swelling, heat, or smell appears at any point** — that's a hard "bad," no further testing.
3. Disconnect from the charger, let it rest unloaded for 10-15 minutes, then measure resting voltage at the TP4056's board-level pads (not the tiny JST pins — those give unreliable/drifting readings).
4. Stable ~3.7-4.2V with no drift → passes Tier 1, proceed to Tier 2. Anything else (still unstable, near 0V, or any physical warning sign) → retire and recycle now, don't proceed further.

**Tier 2 — isolated load test (tester rig, not the real hiking-monitor):**
1. Use one of the 2 spare unused ESP32 DevKitC-32 boards (Bag 1) and one of the 4 spare TP4056 modules (Bag 8) — fully isolated from the working hiking-monitor, zero risk to it.
2. Wire minimally: battery JST → TP4056 battery input; TP4056 boost output (VOUT+/VOUT−) → spare ESP32's VIN/GND.
3. Power on in the fireproof spot and watch the spare ESP32's onboard LED: steady = pass, blinking/resetting (brownout under load) = fail.
4. For a more representative load matching the real device's WiFi-connect current spike (rather than just baseline boot current), optionally flash the spare ESP32 with `hiking-sensor.yaml` first — but change `esphome: name:` first (e.g. `hiking-monitor-test`) so it doesn't collide with the real device's hostname/MQTT identity while both exist.

**Caveat:** neither tier can rule out a slow-forming internal short with full certainty — that needs a proper battery analyzer/ESR meter, probably not worth owning for an ~$8 cell when 2 known-good spares are already on hand.

**Outcome:** Passes both tiers → may be returned to spare stock (log that it had this incident, in case it recurs). Fails either tier → retire and recycle per JCTsh-Build-Standards.md §2.14 (tape JST terminals, recycle at a battery drop-off — Home Depot/Lowe's/Batteries Plus — never household trash).

**Related:** CARD-026 (measure hiking-monitor sleep-mode current draw) uses the same tester rig built for Tier 2 here — do them together in one bench session rather than building the rig twice.

### CARD-026 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Measure hiking-monitor sleep-mode current draw
**Notes:** The hiking-monitor's actual standby battery life is unknown. The ESP32's own deep-sleep draw is negligible (~10µA), but `VOUT+` runs directly to the ESP32's `VIN` with the switch NOT in the power path, so the TP4056+boost module stays active even while the ESP32 sleeps — its quiescent current (undocumented by the manufacturer, plausibly 1-5mA for a cheap module) is almost certainly the real bottleneck. This measurement gives an actual number instead of a guess.

**Reuses the CARD-025 tester rig** (spare ESP32 from Bag 1 + spare TP4056 from Bag 8) — build both cards in the same bench session.

**Setup:**
1. Flash the spare ESP32 with `hiking-sensor.yaml`, but change `esphome: name:` first (e.g. `hiking-monitor-test`) so it doesn't collide with the real device's hostname/MQTT identity. First flash must be via USB.
2. Tie **GPIO32 (dock detect) directly to GND** with a plain jumper — no divider needed for this test. This deterministically signals "no USB present" so the boot logic reliably proceeds into sleep instead of possibly floating and staying awake.
3. Leave **GPIO27 (slide switch) unconnected** — its internal pull-up reads HIGH by default, which the inverted logic treats as "switch OFF," also matching the sleep condition.
4. Sensors (BME280, LTR-390, display) don't need to be attached — I2C read errors will log but won't block the boot sequence from reaching the sleep-entry check.
5. Wire power as in CARD-025: battery → TP4056 BAT input, TP4056 boost output → spare ESP32 VIN/GND.

**Measurement:**
1. Break the battery's positive lead and insert a multimeter in series (DC current mode, mA/µA jack — not the unfused high-current jack).
2. Power on. The `on_boot` priority -200 block should take it into deep sleep within a few seconds.
3. Wait a few seconds past that point, then read the steady-state current — that's the real standby draw.
4. Runtime estimate = 1100mAh ÷ measured current (mA), in hours.

**Outcome:** If the reading confirms the boost module's quiescent current dominates (likely 1-5mA range), consider this as supporting evidence for JCTsh-Build-Standards.md §2.14 point 7 (prefer direct LiPo-to-LDO over boost-then-buck for future builds) — the always-on boost stage is exactly what that recommendation exists to eliminate.

### CARD-023 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Security hardening — cloud accounts (Steps 9–14 + Final)
**Instructions:** `jctsh-security-hardening.md` Steps 9–14 and Final Step  
**Progress (2026-06-20):** Steps 9–12 and 14 complete. One item remaining:
- **Step 13 (router firmware + admin credentials):** Manual — requires home WiFi (`192.168.1.1`). Do alongside CARD-022 Step 6 (UPnP) in same home session.

After Step 13 complete: run Final Step — harvest security patterns to `JCTsh-Build-Standards.md`, then close both CARD-022 and CARD-023.

### CARD-003 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] TLS for Mosquitto (port 8883)
**Notes:** Port 1883 is internet-exposed via DuckDNS/port-forward with fail2ban, but credentials and sensor data are cleartext. TLS on port 8883 eliminates this. Steps: get Let's Encrypt cert for the DuckDNS hostname (certbot with duckdns plugin), add a TLS listener on port 8883 in mosquitto.conf, update mqtt_broker port in every ESPHome secrets.yaml, update Node-RED broker node, update HA MQTT integration, reflash all ESP32s. Do as a standalone task after DuckDNS setup is stable. CARD-002 prerequisite complete.

### CARD-004 · [enhancement] [salt-sensor] Migrate Arduino C++ → ESPHome
**Notes:** Do this before perfboard transfer — ESPHome initializes hardware differently than Arduino and if a strapping pin causes a boot issue it's easier to rewire on breadboard than cut perfboard traces. Device is still on breadboard. Estimated 2–3 hours. Do before CARD-003 (TLS) — TLS on Arduino C++ is brittle and would be thrown away when this migration happens anyway.

**Maps directly — no design work:**
- JSN-SR04T → ESPHome `ultrasonic` platform, same GPIO 5 (trig) / GPIO 18 (echo). Voltage divider stays as-is.
- 15-sample median filter → ESPHome built-in `median` sensor filter, drop-in replacement
- 12-hour interval → `update_interval: 12h`
- OTA → ESPHome native OTA, flash path `C:\esphome\salt-sensor\`
- Heartbeat → standard JCTsh pattern, added for free
- Credentials → `secrets.h` → `secrets.yaml`

**Needs design work:**
- **Custom MQTT payload:** ESPHome publishes to its own topic scheme by default. Maintaining `jctsh/sensors/salt-sensor/data` with `{"distance_cm":25.3}` requires an `on_value` automation with `mqtt.publish` + lambda to format JSON.
- **LED blinking driven by MQTT status:** Arduino loop runs a 500ms blink toggle keyed off subscribed `status` string. ESPHome equivalent: `mqtt.on_message` on status topic updates a global; `interval:` component running every 500ms drives GPIO outputs via lambda. Most involved part of the translation.
- **Test mode:** Backlog originally flagged this as hard, but looking at the sketch there is no test mode code on the ESP32 — test mode is entirely Node-RED publishing fake distances to the data topic. That still works identically with ESPHome. No redesign needed.

**One real risk — strapping pins:** GPIO 2 (red LED) and GPIO 15 (yellow LED) are strapping pins. ESPHome initializes them differently than Arduino at boot. If either is held in the wrong state, the device won't start. Breadboard means quick rewiring to GPIO 32/33 if needed. Estimated 90% chance it works without a pin change.

**What Claude can't do:** verify LEDs blink correctly (physical check); USB flash if OTA fails on first flash (breadboard with USB access, so physical flash is available).

### CARD-024 · [enhancement] [p-w-firefly] Coachproxy remote health monitoring
**Notes:** The coachproxy heartbeat (every 30 min via Tailscale) confirms the RV Pi and Tailscale link are alive, but it can't distinguish between "Pi is powered off" vs "Tailscale is down" vs "RV is in a dead zone." A more useful health check would poll the Tailscale status directly from the home Pi: `tailscale ping 100.90.246.43` or checking the Tailscale admin API for last-seen timestamp. This gives richer diagnostic output (latency, path) without depending on the RV Pi to actively publish. Implement as a scheduled script on the home Pi that posts results to the log dashboard. Alternative: use Tailscale's built-in status API at `localhost:41112` on the home Pi to check peer state without any external requests.

---

### CARD-005 · [enhancement] [p-w-firefly] Overlay filesystem
**Notes:** The Pi in the RV runs continuously, accumulating writes from logs, Tailscale state, and OS housekeeping — SD cards have a finite write cycle life and will eventually fail silently. An overlay filesystem makes the SD card effectively read-only during normal operation: all writes go to RAM, the card is only written during a deliberate shutdown sequence.

**Tailscale complication:** Tailscale stores its node identity and keys in `/var/lib/tailscale/`. If that directory is in the overlay (RAM-only), Tailscale loses its identity on every reboot and needs to re-authenticate. Fix: a persistent bind mount (small USB stick or dedicated partition) mapped to `/var/lib/tailscale/` so it survives reboots.

**eRVin image complication:** Raspbian Buster's modified `raspi-config` does not expose the overlay option in its UI — must be set up manually with `bilibop-lockfs` or equivalent.

**Interim protection:** SanDisk MAX Endurance card already installed.

### CARD-006 · [enhancement] [logging] Move log directory to USB stick
**Priority:** low  
**Notes:** Move LOG_DIR in log_server.py from the SD card to a USB stick plugged into the Pi for better write endurance. Add an /etc/fstab entry so it auto-mounts at boot before the jctsh-logging service starts.

### CARD-019 · [idea] [vu-meter] Home theater VU meters
**Notes:** VU meter displays for home theater speakers — Left, Right, Center, Subwoofer (4 channels). Circuit to be breadboarded first to validate the analog front end before any JCTsh integration work begins.

**Hardware:**
- One ESP32 for all 4 channels — GPIO32/33/34/35 are all ADC1 pins and don't conflict with WiFi
- Display: WS2812B addressable RGB LED strips (color gradient green→yellow→red, software-configurable). Alternatives considered: discrete LEDs, OLED, LED matrix, NeoPixel rings
- Sub input: tap AV receiver RCA (line-level, ~1–2V peak) if powered sub — much simpler than speaker level. Speaker-level tap if passive sub

**Analog front-end circuit (per channel — speaker level):**
- High-side resistor divider ≥100kΩ to avoid loading the amp (speaker load is 4–8Ω; parallel impedance must stay negligible)
- Full-wave rectifier + peak detector capacitor — converts bipolar AC audio signal to positive DC level proportional to loudness
- 10kΩ series resistor before each ADC pin
- Schottky or TVS clamping diodes at ADC pin (to GND and 3.3V) — protect against transients and voltage excursions
- Keep resistor power dissipation in check: at 20V across 100kΩ = 4mW, well within ¼W rating

**Protection concerns:**
- Impedance loading: high-side ≥100kΩ ensures microamp draw; receiver can't tell it's there
- Voltage: speaker level can reach 20–30V peak — divider must scale to 0–3.3V; audio is bipolar so rectification is required before ADC
- Transients: amp spikes at power-on/off — clamping diodes + series resistor handle this
- Ground loops: ESP32 USB ground may differ from audio system ground → 60Hz hum injected into audio. Mitigation: isolated USB wall adapter, high-value sense resistors, or optical isolation (most robust)
- RF noise: ESP32 WiFi radiates RF — keep sense wiring physically separated from speaker cables; consider shielding

**JCTsh smart integration:**
- MQTT topics: `jctsh/components/vu-meter/data` (levels), `jctsh/components/vu-meter/log`, `jctsh/components/vu-meter/cmd` (remote control)
- Publish: per-channel audio level, `is_playing` boolean (derived from threshold + 1s hold)
- Node-RED: detect play/stop transitions → dim/restore theater lighting, turn off AV receiver after N min silence, notify if audio playing after midnight
- Remote display control via cmd topic: brightness, color scheme, sensitivity — adjustable from phone without touching hardware
- Optional: level logging to Google Sheets

**Division of labor:**
- Claude writes: ESPHome YAML (ADC reading, peak detection, WS2812B driving), MQTT schema, Node-RED flows, HA entities
- Physical validation: breadboard analog front end, measure actual output voltage range at typical listening volume, then tune firmware divider constants to match

**Resources:** No single tutorial covers this full stack. Pieces: Hackaday/Instructables (VU meter projects, WS2812B), Andreas Spiess YouTube (ESP32 audio/ADC), EEVblog forums or r/diyelectronics (circuit review before connecting to real equipment), ESPHome docs (firmware). Speaker-level input with proper protection is under-documented — this is an original design.

**Next step:** Breadboard and validate the analog front-end circuit. Measure voltage range at the ADC pin at low, medium, and high listening volumes. Report back before firmware work begins.

### CARD-010 · [enhancement] [front-porch-temp-sensor] Use case definition
**Notes:** Perfboard transfer complete. No enclosure planned. Sensor publishes temp, humidity, pressure, illuminance every 5 min. Perfboard layout: `components/front-porch-temp-sensor/perfboard-layout.md`.

Existing automations: Temp Alert (above threshold+2°F for 10 min) and Temp Dropping (below threshold−2°F for 10 min). Threshold: `input_number.front_porch_temp_threshold` (currently 90°F).

**Candidate use cases:**

**Pre-cooling alert** — temp dropping fast in the evening signals a good time to open windows. Node-RED computes rate of change; notify when drop exceeds X°F in Y minutes after sunset.

**Morning warm-up alert** — temp rising rapidly; close windows before the house heats up.

**Frost likelihood** — frost in the Arizona desert is rare but nuanced.

*Two mechanisms:*
- **Frozen dew** — dew (liquid) forms first when air temp drops to the dew point, then freezes if temp continues below 32°F. Requires dew point above 32°F. Rare in the desert.
- **Deposition frost** — water vapor deposits directly as ice, skipping the liquid phase entirely. This is the relevant type for the Arizona desert, where dew point is almost always below 32°F in winter. Governed by the **frost point** (a separate value from dew point, slightly higher than dew point at sub-freezing temperatures — meaning deposition frost can form at a higher temperature than liquid dew would).

*What matters for the sensor:*
- Dew point already computed by Node-RED from temp + humidity
- Frost point derivable from same inputs via a Node-RED function node
- Radiative cooling on clear nights (illuminance near zero = clear sky proxy) can drop surface temps 5–7°F below air temp — frost on surfaces can occur at 36–38°F air temp in still, clear conditions
- *Frost risk index*: notify when air temp < 38°F AND frost point < 32°F AND nighttime (illuminance ~0)

*Hiking sensor connection:*
Trail elevation makes frost far more likely than at home — the Santa Catalinas rise from ~2,500 ft (Tucson) to 9,000+ ft, roughly 3.5°F cooler per 1,000 ft of gain (~23°F colder at the summit). The hiking sensor measures actual temp and humidity at trail elevation, so it has everything needed to compute dew point and frost point in the field. Two integration points:
- **E-ink display** — add frost point or a frost risk indicator to the display when temp is below a threshold (currently shows temp, humidity, pressure trend, UV, battery)
- **Replay pipeline** — after a hike, the archived temp/humidity records correlated with the GPS track show where on the trail frost conditions existed, for future planning
- **Hike selection** — frost conditions at home (front porch sensor) combined with known elevation lapse rate could inform which trail to choose. If overnight low at 2,500 ft was 42°F, frost point was 28°F, and a trail peaks at 7,000 ft, surface frost is likely above ~5,500 ft. This becomes a reason to seek out a higher-elevation hike specifically to experience frost conditions in the desert.

**UV alert** — LTR-390 already reports UV index. Notify when UV index exceeds a threshold (e.g., 6+) for outdoor activity or plant protection planning.

**Plant protection reminder** — when frost risk is non-zero, notify to cover sensitive plants. Seasonal (December–February in Tucson).

## Done

### CARD-032 · [bug] [photo-server] Heartbeat doesn't detect real storage failures (found 2026-07-08)
**Resolution:** `photo-server-heartbeat.py` now writes, reads back, and removes a marker file (`/data/upload/.heartbeat_check`) *inside* the `immich_server` container on every run where the container itself is confirmed up, catching the exact class of failure Docker's own health check misses (it only pings the Immich API, never touches `/data`). A failure is appended to the same `unhealthy` list and reported as `Alert - storage:<error text>`, using the identical non-collapsing path CARD-029 established for degraded containers. Immediate fix (remount, container restart) and root-cause mitigation (udev auto-remount rule) from the original incident were already in place; this closes the actual monitoring gap.

Live-tested 2026-07-08 by remounting `/mnt/photo-library` read-only (`mount -o remount,ro`) — chosen over physically disconnecting the drive, and over a plain `chmod` on the host-side directory (tried first; silently didn't work, since the container runs as root and root bypasses POSIX permission bits — a read-only remount is enforced at the VFS level instead). Dashboard correctly showed `Immich degraded - storage:sh: 1: cannot create /data/upload/.heartbeat_check: Read-only file system`; remounting read-write restored normal status on the next run. Full writeup in `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md`.

**Still unknown:** the original root physical cause of the USB drive disconnecting in the first place (no clear `dmesg` evidence was captured at the time). Worth checking/reseating the USB cable and capturing full `dmesg` as root if it recurs — not blocking, since the monitoring gap that made it dangerous is now closed.

### CARD-029 · [enhancement] [photo-server] Live-test Immich degraded-heartbeat alert path
**Resolution:** Live-tested 2026-07-08 now that the Immich migration is complete. `docker stop immich_redis` produced `Immich degraded - immich_redis:unhealthy` (then `:starting` during the restart race) as a non-collapsing `Alert` row on the dashboard; `docker start immich_redis` restored normal `System`/online status on the next run. Combined with the CARD-032 storage-check test in the same session. Full writeup in `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md`.

---

### CARD-036 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Dashboard visibility for scheduled reboots
**Resolution:** CARD-035's scheduled reboots were invisible on the JCTsh log dashboard — confirming success required manually SSHing in and checking `systemctl`/`docker ps`. Added a matched pair of MQTT log messages around each reboot: `scheduled-reboot.service` now publishes `"Scheduled reboot about to occur."` immediately before calling `/sbin/reboot` (multiple `ExecStart=` lines in the oneshot unit), and a new `reboot-complete.service` (enabled via `WantedBy=multi-user.target`) publishes `"Boot complete."` on every boot once the MQTT broker is reachable. Pi publishes as component `jctsh-core` to `jctsh/core/log-server/log` using the existing `jctsh-log-server` MQTT account (`/etc/jctsh/log-server.env`) via `mosquitto_pub` (already installed). M8 publishes as component `photo-server` to `jctsh/server/photo-server/log` using the existing `photo-server` MQTT account (`/etc/jctsh/heartbeat.env`) — required installing the `mosquitto-clients` apt package on the M8 (the heartbeat script uses Python `paho-mqtt` instead, so the CLI wasn't already present). Neither message uses the `"Heartbeat - "` prefix, so each occurrence stays visible as its own dashboard row rather than collapsing. Per-host unit files split out: `scheduled-reboot-pi.service`/`scheduled-reboot-m8.service` replace the old shared `scheduled-reboot.service` (now host-specific since the MQTT broker address, credentials file, and topic differ per host). Verified live 2026-07-08 via manual `systemctl start reboot-complete.service` on both hosts — confirmed on the dashboard (`/data` live view and, after flushing, the persisted `/log` file).

### CARD-037 · [bug] [photo-server] ML processing (faces, smart search, duplicates, OCR) never ran on a large fraction of the library
**Resolution:** Discovered 2026-07-08 while answering Joseph's question about why most photos showed no identified people in Properties. Diagnosed via the Immich API (not guesswork): a random sample showed ~80% of assets with zero detected faces; a targeted CLIP-search sample of clearly-portrait photos still showed clean detection (26/30 correct), ruling out a model-confidence issue. Definitive proof came from a duplicate pair — the exact same restaurant photo (Immich's own duplicate-detection linked the two copies) had 7 faces detected on one copy and 0 on the other.

**Not specific to Joseph's chaotic import:** checked Robin's library too (via her own API key, since search is scoped per-user) — 96% zero-face rate, even higher than Joseph's ~80%, despite her import running clean with no crashes/restarts (see `components/photo-server/migration.md`). This ruled out the 5-restart-import theory as the sole cause and confirmed the gap was server-wide, affecting both accounts roughly equally.

**Fix:** triggered all five affected ML jobs (`faceDetection`, `facialRecognition`, `smartSearch`, `ocr`, `duplicateDetection`) via `PUT /api/jobs/{name}` (`{"command":"start"}`) — Immich has no dry-run mode, so starting each job was simultaneously the diagnostic (revealing real backlogs: ~140,000 for faces, 33,201 for duplicates, ~17,000 each for smartSearch/OCR) and the fix. Checked load average and `vmstat` before/during (CPU-bound at ~60% user time, only 3-7% iowait — not I/O-bound, plenty of headroom on the 12-core M8) to confirm it was safe to run all five concurrently.

**Confirmed complete 2026-07-09** (ran overnight, unaffected by an unrelated home-internet outage since the jobs run locally on the M8): all five queues back to 0 waiting/active, 0 failed for the entire run. M8 uptime at completion check was 19h36m — never rebooted, confirming genuine completion rather than a state reset. Total people clusters grew 2,626 → 3,331 (+705) as full coverage let previously-under-threshold clusters (`minFaces: 3`) surface. Final spot-check: the `868900f1` duplicate that started the whole investigation at 0 faces now shows all 7, with Joseph and Robin correctly matched by name. `duplicateDetection` found 2,197 duplicate groups total once it had full coverage — worth a manual review pass in the Duplicates view when convenient, not urgent.

### CARD-035 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Weekly scheduled reboot — Pi and M8 photo-server
**Resolution:** Deployed systemd timers on both hosts: `scheduled-reboot.timer` → `scheduled-reboot.service` (`/sbin/reboot`), `Persistent=true`. Pi: Monday 3:00 AM. M8: Monday 4:00 AM — staggered one hour later so the M8 heartbeat script's MQTT publish to the Pi's Mosquitto broker doesn't collide with the Pi being mid-reboot. Not synchronized to KeepConnect's own weekly router reset — that schedule has drifted from its original Wednesday setting, most likely because its "every 7 days" timer restarts from any reset (scheduled or outage-triggered), so it can't be relied on as a fixed weekday anyway; a router reboot's brief network blip is tolerated regardless of timing. Version-controlled unit files in `core/maintenance/`; documented in `SOFTWARE-ENVIRONMENT.md` (Pi) and new `components/photo-server/operations.md` (M8). Verified live via `systemctl list-timers` on both hosts — next run confirmed Mon 2026-07-13. 2026-07-08.

---

### CARD-033 · [idea] [infrastructure] Document Keep Connect configuration and schedule
**Resolution:** KeepConnect is a standalone router-rebooter device (Johnson Creative KeepConnect-27F8, not a JCTsh component). New dedicated doc `keepconnect.md` created at repo root with full device identity, network config, physical outlet-scoping rationale, and complete monitor/timing/schedule/notification configuration. Linked from `jctsh-network.md` devices table (IP 192.168.1.108, DHCP-reserved) and `ENVIRONMENT.md` Hub & Controller table; added to `README.md` repository layout. Remaining open item (scheduled Pi/Immich reboot via cron, separate from power-strip cycling) carried forward in `keepconnect.md` itself. 2026-07-08.

---

### CARD-021 · [enhancement] [logging] Device status dashboard
**Resolution:** Added `/status` endpoint to `core/logging/log_server.py`. Two-section layout: Home (Online/Offline/? per component based on heartbeat presence and 70-min threshold) and Remote (`coachproxyos` always shows last-activity + `?`). Auto-detects heartbeat-capable components — salt-sensor shows `?` until CARD-004 ESPHome migration adds heartbeats. Deployed to Pi 2026-06-30. Added CARD-024 (coachproxy remote health monitoring via Tailscale ping).

---

### CARD-018 · [idea] [immich] Self-hosted photo library
**Resolution:** Superseded. Hardware (GMKtec M8) in hand. Replaced by `components/photo-server/` (Immich install + immich-go migration) and `components/photo-tv-display/` (Node.js TV slideshow + phone companion) — full planning docs committed 2026-06-30.

---

### CARD-014 · [enhancement] [core] Move environmental data pipeline to core
**Resolution:** Moved `environmental-data.gs` → `core/data-pipeline/`, `JCTsh-Environmental-Data-Architecture.md` → `core/data-pipeline/`, and `core/node-red/environmental-data.flow.json` → `core/data-pipeline/`. Updated references across 15 files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, Node-RED-workflow.md, JCTsh-Build-Standards.md, JCTsh-Component-Planning-Pattern.md, JCTsh-Property-Sensor-Pattern.md, all component planning docs, hiking-sensor instructions). 2026-06-30.

---

### CARD-002 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] MQTT v3.1.1 → v5 upgrade
**Resolution:** Mosquitto 2.0.21 already supports v5 — no broker config change needed. Changed `protocolVersion` from 4 → 5 in the Node-RED broker config node (`core/node-red/core.flow.json`) and updated the live Pi flows.json in place. Confirmed via Mosquitto log: client `nodered-saltlevel` connected with `p5`. ESP32/ESPHome devices unaffected (remain on v3.1.1). 2026-06-30.

---

### CARD-008 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Pixel hotspot second WiFi field test
**Notes:** Confirmed 2026-06-17 during camping trip. Device connected to JCT Hotspot (IP 10.57.172.159 — Pixel hotspot subnet), reached home MQTT broker via jctsh.duckdns.org over cellular, replayed 7 SPIFFS readings on reconnect. DuckDNS + port 1883 forward confirmed working in the field.

---

### CARD-017 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Charging state schema fields for solar/battery sensors
**Resolution:** Added `solar_v` (solar panel voltage, V, ADC voltage divider) to the environmental data schema. Decision: `solar_v` chosen over `charging` boolean (not universally available on all charge controllers) and `charge_current_ma` (requires INA219, overkill). Combined with `battery_v`, charging state is derivable in Node-RED or Sheets as `solar_v > battery_v + ~0.3V`. Added to field reference and Sheets schema in `JCTsh-Environmental-Data-Architecture.md` (v1.4), column Z in `components/hiking-sensor/environmental-data.gs`, and Apps Script redeployed. 2026-06-15.

---

### CARD-016 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Offline flash logging — extract reusable standard
**Resolution:** Created `core/offline-logger/sensor_logger.h` — generic template header with `sensor_log_*` function prefix (adapt by renaming to `<name>_log_*` and updating the log file path). Added "Offline Flash Logging" section to `JCTsh-Property-Sensor-Pattern.md` with template adaptation instructions, on_boot mount snippet, on_connect replay block (500ms settle delay), and interval guard (connected → publish, offline → log_write). Removed CARD-016 from pattern doc Open Gaps. 2026-06-14.

---

### CARD-015 · [enhancement] [front-porch-temp-sensor] Environmental data pipeline integration
**Resolution:** Added SNTP, humidity/pressure IDs, and 5-min `/data` publish to firmware (temp, humidity, pressure, illuminance, lat/lon H8, rssi, ISO 8601 UTC). Added `illuminance_lx` to the environmental data schema and Apps Script. Node-RED wildcard caught it automatically — no flow changes. OTA flashed 2026-06-14.

---

### CARD-007 · [idea] [hiking-sensor] Hiking observations pipeline (Tasker → Sheets)
**Resolution:** Tasker widget → Android speech recognition → HTTP POST to Apps Script → Hiking Observations sheet with automatic category classification. No keyword prefix — widget tap is the intent signal. Steps 23–26 complete 2026-06-13.
