## Backlog

### CARD-0046 · [enhancement] [photo-server] Extend storage-health check to cover backup drive(s), not just primary
**Notes:** Discovered 2026-07-10 during the drive-swap incident (see DEVLOG.md) — while connecting a new backup drive, Momentus (`/mnt/photo-library-backup`) suffered a real hardware-level failure (`dmesg`: "device offline error", "Buffer I/O error", "JBD2: I/O error when updating journal superblock", forced unmount), likely from a jostled USB connector during the drive swap. This produced **zero dashboard visibility** — CARD-0032's storage-health check (in `photo-server-heartbeat.py`) only verifies read/write access to `/data/upload` inside the `immich_server` container, which lives on the *primary* library mount. It has no visibility into either backup drive (Momentus or the new Joseph-dedicated Expansion/Seagate 1TB) since Immich itself never touches them — only the standalone `photo-library-backup.sh` script does, and even with CARD-0040's start/complete/failed MQTT messages, that only reports at the next scheduled or manual run, not continuously. The failure was only caught because Claude happened to be manually checking `dmesg` while troubleshooting something unrelated.

For comparison, the primary library going read-only during the same incident *was* caught correctly and appeared on the dashboard (`"storage:sh: 1: cannot create /data/upload/.heartbeat_check: Read-only file system"`) — CARD-0032 worked exactly as designed for the mount it covers.

**Proposed fix:** extend `photo-server-heartbeat.py`'s storage check to also write/read/remove a marker file on both backup mount points (`/mnt/photo-library-backup`, `/mnt/photo-library-backup-joseph`) every 30-minute heartbeat cycle, reporting via the same non-collapsing `Alert`-category path already established for the primary. Not urgent — the backup drives are secondary copies, not the live-serving primary — but worth closing given it's now a demonstrated real gap, not a theoretical one.

### CARD-0041 · [idea] [photo-server] Disk capacity growth analysis — wait for steady state
**Notes:** Discussed 2026-07-09: want to estimate photo-library growth rate and project when the primary drive (Backup Plus 1TB, currently 615G/71% used) or backup drive (Momentus 640GB) will need replacing/upsizing. Deliberately not started yet — Joseph's call: current disk numbers are all noise from one-off events (CARD-0039 added 3,433 assets in one shot, CARD-0030 just freed 818GB by deleting zips, first post-cleanup backup run is still doing a full reconciliation rather than a normal weekly delta), not representative of organic day-to-day growth.

**Wait for:** the backup cron (CARD-0030/CARD-0040) running its normal weekly incremental cadence for a few cycles, so disk usage tracking reflects only real photo uploads from Joseph's and Robin's phones. At that point, weekly rsync deltas become a meaningful proxy for actual growth rate and a "months until full" estimate becomes trustworthy rather than a guess. Revisit this card once that's true — no fixed date, just "after the dust settles."

### CARD-0045 · [bug] [hiking-sensor] `wifi.ap:` fallback may prevent `reboot_timeout` from working
**Notes:** Found 2026-07-09 while researching a timeout decision for air-quality-monitor (which follows hiking-sensor's firmware pattern). `hiking-sensor.yaml`'s `wifi:` block has no explicit `reboot_timeout` override, so it relies on ESPHome's default (15 minutes before rebooting on failed WiFi connection). However, ESPHome's own issue tracker (esphome/issues#7222) documents that `reboot_timeout` does not apply when a `wifi.ap:` fallback block is configured — and hiking-sensor's config does have one (`ap: ssid: "hiking-monitor-fallback"`). So the 15-minute default may not actually be functioning as designed on the currently-deployed device.

**Priority: low.** Hiking-sensor's upload/home mode requires USB dock power to stay awake (same architecture as air-quality-monitor's charging-based home mode) — if the bug does prevent the reboot from firing, the device would get stuck awake trying to reconnect, but on USB power, not draining battery. No confirmed real-world failure — CARD-0008's actual field test (2026-06-17 camping trip) succeeded without issue. Worst case is a minor operational annoyance (stuck device needing a physical USB reflash to recover), not data loss or a safety risk.

**Resolution path:** confirm whether hiking-sensor actually needs the `ap:` fallback block at all (original rationale not documented in current firmware/docs — may be leftover from early development). If not needed, remove it and the default `reboot_timeout` should function normally. If needed, find an alternative bounded-recovery mechanism that doesn't conflict with the AP fallback.

### CARD-0038 · [idea] [garage-entry-hallway] Direction-of-travel sensor for hallway to garage entry door
**Notes:** Detect which direction a person is walking through the hallway leading to the garage entry door (coming in from the garage vs. heading out to it) — e.g. for automations like arming/disarming, lighting, or logging comings and goings. Discussed 2026-07-09: single HLK-LD2412 mmWave radar (already proven in `components/garage-radar/garage-radar.yaml`) recommended over a two-JSN-SR04T ultrasonic beam-gate — direction derived from the `moving_distance` trend (falling = approaching, rising = receding) via ESPHome's native `ld2412` component, rather than needing two sensors racing to trigger first. Two JSN-SR04T-V3.0 units already in inventory (Bag 30) but better reserved for a point-distance use case (e.g. tank level) rather than this one. No planning doc yet — not started.

### CARD-0034 · [idea] [personal] Complete digital-identity-protection-checklist.md
**Notes:** Work through `digital-identity-protection-checklist.md` (repo root) — Joseph and Robin's personal security checklist closing single-point-of-failure risks (carrier port-out PIN, 2FA off SMS, credit freezes, password manager, household verification protocol, incident response plan). Almost entirely manual actions by Joseph/Robin themselves (phone calls to carriers/bureaus, account settings changes) — not something Claude Code can execute directly, but worth tracking to completion since it's currently all unchecked. Also has an "Open Items to Fill In" section (list specific banks/brokerages in use, confirm current password manager/2FA setup, set a 6-month review date) that needs input from Joseph before those parts can be finished.

### CARD-0031 · [bug] [p-w-firefly] Fix coachproxyos heartbeat's same publish/disconnect race condition
**Notes:** While debugging false "photo-server silent for 35 minutes" watchdog alerts (2026-07-06), found the root cause: `photo-server-heartbeat.py` published its `/log` and `/heartbeat` MQTT messages (QoS 1) back-to-back then called `client.disconnect()` immediately without running the network loop — occasionally the second publish's packet hadn't fully flushed before the socket closed, silently dropping the `/heartbeat` message while `/log` (published first) always got through. Fixed in photo-server's script via `client.loop_start()` + `wait_for_publish(timeout=5)` on both messages before `loop_stop()`/`disconnect()`. See `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md` for full root-cause writeup.

`components/p-w-firefly/jctsh-heartbeat.py` (coachproxyos, the RV Pi) uses the identical publish-then-disconnect pattern and almost certainly has the same latent bug — just less noticeable since a stray "coachproxyos silent" alert is easy to dismiss for a device that's expected to roam in and out of Tailscale range. Apply the same fix: `loop_start()` → publish both → `wait_for_publish()` on both → `loop_stop()` → `disconnect()`.

**Blocked:** RV Pi wasn't reachable (Tailscale down / not home) when this was found — deploy next time `coachproxyos` is reachable at `100.90.246.43` or `192.168.1.219`.

### CARD-0028 · [idea] [photo-server] Automated post-import quality scan (blur/duplicate detection)
**Notes:** Decided during photo-server migration (2026-07-04) to skip a manual pre-import quality pass entirely — importing everything as-is and relying on Immich's built-in duplicate detection (CLIP-embedding-based visual similarity, not just byte-hash) plus an ongoing "favorites" curation habit over time. This card captures the option to add an *automated* (no manual photo review) quality pass later, run after the Immich import so you can see real results first before deciding if it's worth doing.

**Tools considered (all scriptable, no manual visual review required):**
- **czkawka** — free, open source (Rust), finds exact + visually-similar duplicates, plus blurry/broken images; has a CLI, could run directly on the M8 against the Immich library folder
- **imagededup** (Python, by Idealo) — perceptual-hash + CNN-based near-duplicate detection, scriptable
- **fdupes** / **rdfind** — simple exact-byte-duplicate finders (fast, catches literal copies only, not near-duplicates)
- **DIY blur-score script** — e.g. OpenCV Laplacian-variance blur detection, a small Python script with a numeric threshold; could be built on request, nothing off-the-shelf needed
- (Commercial alternatives exist — Aftershoot, Narrative Select — but are built for photographers culling shoots, overkill for a one-time family library pass)

**CLIP note:** Immich's own duplicate detection and smart search are both powered by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, OpenAI) — specifically `ViT-B-32__openai` on this install. Duplicate detection compares visual embeddings (catches near-duplicates like burst shots), not just identical files, and never auto-deletes — it surfaces candidates in a "Duplicates" review screen for manual confirm.

**Important constraint:** any of these tools can run and *report* findings anytime, including post-import, directly against files on disk. But once Immich owns the library, actually *deleting/archiving* anything found must go through Immich itself (its UI/API) — not direct filesystem deletion — since Immich tracks every asset in its Postgres DB and a raw file delete would desync the DB (broken thumbnails, orphaned references). Ties into the planned deletion-logging system (photo-server Step 14).

**Sequencing:** wait until after Joseph's (and later Robin's) Immich import completes and ML processing (duplicate detection, facial recognition) has run. See what Immich's own built-in detection surfaces first, then decide whether an additional automated tool is worth adding.

### CARD-0027 · [idea] [hiking-sensor] GPIO-controlled power gating for I2C peripherals during sleep
**Notes:** Observed 2026-07-03: after putting the device to sleep (display correctly shows "Hiking monitor asleep"), the ESP32's and LTR-390's onboard power-indicator LEDs stayed lit. These are hardwired to their respective 3.3V rails, not GPIO-controlled — ESP32 deep sleep only stops the CPU from executing, it does not cut power to anything downstream. Since `VOUT+` runs directly to ESP32 `VIN` (switch not in the power path) and nothing gates the I2C peripherals' power, BME280 and LTR-390 stay fully powered and drawing their own operating current for the entire "sleep" duration, in addition to the boost module's own quiescent draw (see CARD-0026).

**Idea:** add a small P-FET (or similar high-side load switch) on the 3.3V rail feeding BME280 + LTR-390 (and possibly the e-ink display), gated by a spare GPIO, so the firmware can fully cut peripheral power during deep sleep and re-enable it on wake. Would reduce real standby current beyond what CARD-0026 measures for the current design.

**Sequencing:** do CARD-0026 (measure actual sleep current) first — if the measured number is already acceptable for realistic storage durations, this added complexity may not be worth it. Only pursue if CARD-0026 reveals standby drain is a real problem.

**What a P-FET is (for later reference):** a P-channel Field-Effect Transistor — a transistor that acts as a switch, well-suited to sit on the *positive* supply line and turn power on/off to something downstream (a "high-side switch"). The GPIO does not carry power to the rail itself — it only controls the P-FET's gate (a control signal, negligible current). The actual power path is the P-FET's own source-to-drain channel, wired in-line on the 3.3V rail between the supply and the sensors:

```
3.3V rail ──► P-FET source ──► P-FET drain ──► Sensors (BME280, LTR-390)
                      │
GPIO pin ─────────────┘ (controls the gate only)
```

GPIO pulls the gate low (relative to source) → P-FET turns on → 3.3V flows through to the sensors. GPIO drives the gate high (same as source) → P-FET turns off → sensors disconnected, no power reaches them. P-FET specifically (not the more common N-FET) because P-FETs turn on with the gate pulled low relative to source, which is the natural way to switch a high-side/positive-rail connection with a simple GPIO pin; N-FETs are easier to use on the low side (switching the ground return), which doesn't fit well here since you generally don't want to float the ground of a shared I2C bus. Practically: one small transistor (a few cents) plus maybe a resistor.

**Where exactly to place it:** confirmed via `wiring.md` — the TP4056+boost module's 5.7V output feeds the ESP32's `VIN` pin, and the ESP32 dev board's own onboard regulator steps that down to 3.3V, exposed on its `3.3V` pin. That `3.3V` pin (not the boost module's output directly) is the actual source of the rail feeding BME280, LTR-390, and the e-ink display today. The P-FET must go **between the ESP32's `3.3V` pin and the sensors** — not between the boost module and the ESP32's `VIN`. Gating the boost-to-`VIN` connection instead would cut power to the ESP32 itself, which can't work, since the ESP32 needs to stay powered and running in order to control the gate signal in the first place. Gating only the downstream sensor branch keeps the ESP32 awake and in control throughout, switching off only the sensors.

**Standards cross-reference:** logged as a candidate pattern in `JCTsh-Build-Standards.md` §2.14 point 8 (v1.11) — flagged `[CANDIDATE — not yet required, pending validation]`, not a mandatory requirement yet. Once this card is built and measured, promote §2.14 point 8 to a real required numbered standard if it proves worthwhile.

### CARD-0025 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Test retired LiPo battery — good or bad?
**Notes:** The hiking-monitor's original LiPo battery failed in the field (2026-07-03) with no advance warning and was replaced from spare stock (2 EEMB 603449 cells remain in Bag 7). Before permanently retiring/recycling the original cell, run this test to determine whether it's actually damaged or just tripped its built-in PCM protection circuit (which would reset after a proper recharge).

**Tier 1 — recharge-and-rest check:**
1. Place the cell in a fireproof/non-flammable spot (LiPo charging bag once purchased — see JCTsh-Build-Standards.md §2.14 — or a ceramic plate/metal tray in the meantime).
2. Connect to a TP4056 module and charge for 30-60 minutes. Watch for the charge-complete LED signal. **Stop immediately if any swelling, heat, or smell appears at any point** — that's a hard "bad," no further testing.
3. Disconnect from the charger, let it rest unloaded for 10-15 minutes, then measure resting voltage at the TP4056's board-level pads (not the tiny JST pins — those give unreliable/drifting readings).
4. Stable ~3.7-4.2V with no drift → passes Tier 1, proceed to Tier 2. Anything else (still unstable, near 0V, or any physical warning sign) → retire and recycle now, don't proceed further.

**Tier 2 — isolated load test (tester rig, not the real hiking-monitor):**
1. Use one of the 2 spare unused ESP32 DevKitC-32 boards (Bag 1) and one of the 4 spare TP4056 modules (Bag 8) — fully isolated from the working hiking-monitor, zero risk to it.
2. Wire minimally: battery JST → TP4056 battery input; TP4056 boost output (VOUT+/VOUT−) → spare ESP32's VIN/GND.
3. Power on in the fireproof spot and watch the spare ESP32's onboard LED: steady = pass, blinking/resetting (brownout under load) = fail.
4. For a more representative load matching the real device's WiFi-connect current spike (rather than just baseline boot current), optionally flash the spare ESP32 with `hiking-sensor.yaml` first — but change `esphome: name:` first (e.g. `hiking-monitor-test`) so it doesn't collide with the real device's hostname/MQTT identity while both exist.

**Caveat:** neither tier can rule out a slow-forming internal short with full certainty — that needs a proper battery analyzer/ESR meter, probably not worth owning for an ~$8 cell when 2 known-good spares are already on hand.

**Outcome:** Passes both tiers → may be returned to spare stock (log that it had this incident, in case it recurs). Fails either tier → retire and recycle per JCTsh-Build-Standards.md §2.14 (tape JST terminals, recycle at a battery drop-off — Home Depot/Lowe's/Batteries Plus — never household trash).

**Related:** CARD-0026 (measure hiking-monitor sleep-mode current draw) uses the same tester rig built for Tier 2 here — do them together in one bench session rather than building the rig twice.

### CARD-0026 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Measure hiking-monitor sleep-mode current draw
**Notes:** The hiking-monitor's actual standby battery life is unknown. The ESP32's own deep-sleep draw is negligible (~10µA), but `VOUT+` runs directly to the ESP32's `VIN` with the switch NOT in the power path, so the TP4056+boost module stays active even while the ESP32 sleeps — its quiescent current (undocumented by the manufacturer, plausibly 1-5mA for a cheap module) is almost certainly the real bottleneck. This measurement gives an actual number instead of a guess.

**Reuses the CARD-0025 tester rig** (spare ESP32 from Bag 1 + spare TP4056 from Bag 8) — build both cards in the same bench session.

**Setup:**
1. Flash the spare ESP32 with `hiking-sensor.yaml`, but change `esphome: name:` first (e.g. `hiking-monitor-test`) so it doesn't collide with the real device's hostname/MQTT identity. First flash must be via USB.
2. Tie **GPIO32 (dock detect) directly to GND** with a plain jumper — no divider needed for this test. This deterministically signals "no USB present" so the boot logic reliably proceeds into sleep instead of possibly floating and staying awake.
3. Leave **GPIO27 (slide switch) unconnected** — its internal pull-up reads HIGH by default, which the inverted logic treats as "switch OFF," also matching the sleep condition.
4. Sensors (BME280, LTR-390, display) don't need to be attached — I2C read errors will log but won't block the boot sequence from reaching the sleep-entry check.
5. Wire power as in CARD-0025: battery → TP4056 BAT input, TP4056 boost output → spare ESP32 VIN/GND.

**Measurement:**
1. Break the battery's positive lead and insert a multimeter in series (DC current mode, mA/µA jack — not the unfused high-current jack).
2. Power on. The `on_boot` priority -200 block should take it into deep sleep within a few seconds.
3. Wait a few seconds past that point, then read the steady-state current — that's the real standby draw.
4. Runtime estimate = 1100mAh ÷ measured current (mA), in hours.

**Outcome:** If the reading confirms the boost module's quiescent current dominates (likely 1-5mA range), consider this as supporting evidence for JCTsh-Build-Standards.md §2.14 point 7 (prefer direct LiPo-to-LDO over boost-then-buck for future builds) — the always-on boost stage is exactly what that recommendation exists to eliminate.

### CARD-0003 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] TLS for Mosquitto (port 8883)
**Notes:** Port 1883 is internet-exposed via DuckDNS/port-forward with fail2ban, but credentials and sensor data are cleartext. TLS on port 8883 eliminates this. Steps: get Let's Encrypt cert for the DuckDNS hostname (certbot with duckdns plugin), add a TLS listener on port 8883 in mosquitto.conf, update mqtt_broker port in every ESPHome secrets.yaml, update Node-RED broker node, update HA MQTT integration, reflash all ESP32s. Do as a standalone task after DuckDNS setup is stable. CARD-0002 prerequisite complete.

### CARD-0024 · [enhancement] [p-w-firefly] Coachproxy remote health monitoring
**Notes:** The coachproxy heartbeat (every 30 min via Tailscale) confirms the RV Pi and Tailscale link are alive, but it can't distinguish between "Pi is powered off" vs "Tailscale is down" vs "RV is in a dead zone." A more useful health check would poll the Tailscale status directly from the home Pi: `tailscale ping 100.90.246.43` or checking the Tailscale admin API for last-seen timestamp. This gives richer diagnostic output (latency, path) without depending on the RV Pi to actively publish. Implement as a scheduled script on the home Pi that posts results to the log dashboard. Alternative: use Tailscale's built-in status API at `localhost:41112` on the home Pi to check peer state without any external requests.

---

### CARD-0005 · [enhancement] [p-w-firefly] Overlay filesystem
**Notes:** The Pi in the RV runs continuously, accumulating writes from logs, Tailscale state, and OS housekeeping — SD cards have a finite write cycle life and will eventually fail silently. An overlay filesystem makes the SD card effectively read-only during normal operation: all writes go to RAM, the card is only written during a deliberate shutdown sequence.

**Tailscale complication:** Tailscale stores its node identity and keys in `/var/lib/tailscale/`. If that directory is in the overlay (RAM-only), Tailscale loses its identity on every reboot and needs to re-authenticate. Fix: a persistent bind mount (small USB stick or dedicated partition) mapped to `/var/lib/tailscale/` so it survives reboots.

**eRVin image complication:** Raspbian Buster's modified `raspi-config` does not expose the overlay option in its UI — must be set up manually with `bilibop-lockfs` or equivalent.

**Interim protection:** SanDisk MAX Endurance card already installed.

### CARD-0006 · [enhancement] [logging] Move log directory to USB stick
**Priority:** low  
**Notes:** Move LOG_DIR in log_server.py from the SD card to a USB stick plugged into the Pi for better write endurance. Add an /etc/fstab entry so it auto-mounts at boot before the jctsh-logging service starts.

### CARD-0019 · [idea] [vu-meter] Home theater VU meters
**Notes:** VU meter displays for home theater speakers — Left, Right, Center, Subwoofer (4 channels). Circuit to be breadboarded first to validate the analog front end before any JCTsh integration work begins.

**Hardware:**
- One ESP32 for all 4 channels — GPIO32/33/34/35 are all ADC1 pins and don't conflict with WiFi
- Display: WS2812B addressable RGB LED strips (color gradient green→yellow→red, software-configurable). Alternatives considered: discrete LEDs, OLED, LED matrix, NeoPixel rings
- Sub input: tap AV receiver RCA (line-level, ~1–2V peak) if powered sub — much simpler than speaker level. Speaker-level tap if passive sub

**Analog front-end circuit (per channel — speaker level):**
- High-side resistor divider ≥100kΩ to avoid loading the amp (speaker load is 4–8Ω; parallel impedance must stay negligible)
- Full-wave rectifier + peak detector capacitor — converts bipolar AC audio signal to positive DC level proportional to loudness
- 10kΩ series resistor before each ADC pin
- Schottky or TVS clamping diodes at ADC pin (to GND and 3.3V) — protect against transients and voltage excursions
- Keep resistor power dissipation in check: at 20V across 100kΩ = 4mW, well within ¼W rating

**Protection concerns:**
- Impedance loading: high-side ≥100kΩ ensures microamp draw; receiver can't tell it's there
- Voltage: speaker level can reach 20–30V peak — divider must scale to 0–3.3V; audio is bipolar so rectification is required before ADC
- Transients: amp spikes at power-on/off — clamping diodes + series resistor handle this
- Ground loops: ESP32 USB ground may differ from audio system ground → 60Hz hum injected into audio. Mitigation: isolated USB wall adapter, high-value sense resistors, or optical isolation (most robust)
- RF noise: ESP32 WiFi radiates RF — keep sense wiring physically separated from speaker cables; consider shielding

**JCTsh smart integration:**
- MQTT topics: `jctsh/components/vu-meter/data` (levels), `jctsh/components/vu-meter/log`, `jctsh/components/vu-meter/cmd` (remote control)
- Publish: per-channel audio level, `is_playing` boolean (derived from threshold + 1s hold)
- Node-RED: detect play/stop transitions → dim/restore theater lighting, turn off AV receiver after N min silence, notify if audio playing after midnight
- Remote display control via cmd topic: brightness, color scheme, sensitivity — adjustable from phone without touching hardware
- Optional: level logging to Google Sheets

**Division of labor:**
- Claude writes: ESPHome YAML (ADC reading, peak detection, WS2812B driving), MQTT schema, Node-RED flows, HA entities
- Physical validation: breadboard analog front end, measure actual output voltage range at typical listening volume, then tune firmware divider constants to match

**Resources:** No single tutorial covers this full stack. Pieces: Hackaday/Instructables (VU meter projects, WS2812B), Andreas Spiess YouTube (ESP32 audio/ADC), EEVblog forums or r/diyelectronics (circuit review before connecting to real equipment), ESPHome docs (firmware). Speaker-level input with proper protection is under-documented — this is an original design.

**Next step:** Breadboard and validate the analog front-end circuit. Measure voltage range at the ADC pin at low, medium, and high listening volumes. Report back before firmware work begins.

### CARD-0010 · [enhancement] [front-porch-temp-sensor] Use case definition
**Notes:** Perfboard transfer complete. No enclosure planned. Sensor publishes temp, humidity, pressure, illuminance every 5 min. Perfboard layout: `components/front-porch-temp-sensor/perfboard-layout.md`.

Existing automations: Temp Alert (above threshold+2°F for 10 min) and Temp Dropping (below threshold−2°F for 10 min). Threshold: `input_number.front_porch_temp_threshold` (currently 90°F).

**Candidate use cases:**

**Pre-cooling alert** — temp dropping fast in the evening signals a good time to open windows. Node-RED computes rate of change; notify when drop exceeds X°F in Y minutes after sunset.

**Morning warm-up alert** — temp rising rapidly; close windows before the house heats up.

**Frost likelihood** — frost in the Arizona desert is rare but nuanced.

*Two mechanisms:*
- **Frozen dew** — dew (liquid) forms first when air temp drops to the dew point, then freezes if temp continues below 32°F. Requires dew point above 32°F. Rare in the desert.
- **Deposition frost** — water vapor deposits directly as ice, skipping the liquid phase entirely. This is the relevant type for the Arizona desert, where dew point is almost always below 32°F in winter. Governed by the **frost point** (a separate value from dew point, slightly higher than dew point at sub-freezing temperatures — meaning deposition frost can form at a higher temperature than liquid dew would).

*What matters for the sensor:*
- Dew point already computed by Node-RED from temp + humidity
- Frost point derivable from same inputs via a Node-RED function node
- Radiative cooling on clear nights (illuminance near zero = clear sky proxy) can drop surface temps 5–7°F below air temp — frost on surfaces can occur at 36–38°F air temp in still, clear conditions
- *Frost risk index*: notify when air temp < 38°F AND frost point < 32°F AND nighttime (illuminance ~0)

*Hiking sensor connection:*
Trail elevation makes frost far more likely than at home — the Santa Catalinas rise from ~2,500 ft (Tucson) to 9,000+ ft, roughly 3.5°F cooler per 1,000 ft of gain (~23°F colder at the summit). The hiking sensor measures actual temp and humidity at trail elevation, so it has everything needed to compute dew point and frost point in the field. Two integration points:
- **E-ink display** — add frost point or a frost risk indicator to the display when temp is below a threshold (currently shows temp, humidity, pressure trend, UV, battery)
- **Replay pipeline** — after a hike, the archived temp/humidity records correlated with the GPS track show where on the trail frost conditions existed, for future planning
- **Hike selection** — frost conditions at home (front porch sensor) combined with known elevation lapse rate could inform which trail to choose. If overnight low at 2,500 ft was 42°F, frost point was 28°F, and a trail peaks at 7,000 ft, surface frost is likely above ~5,500 ft. This becomes a reason to seek out a higher-elevation hike specifically to experience frost conditions in the desert.

**UV alert** — LTR-390 already reports UV index. Notify when UV index exceeds a threshold (e.g., 6+) for outdoor activity or plant protection planning.

**Plant protection reminder** — when frost risk is non-zero, notify to cover sensitive plants. Seasonal (December–February in Tucson).

## Planning

### CARD-0044 · [idea] [remote-temp-sensor-01] Backyard solar/battery environmental sensor
**Planning docs:** `components/remote-temp-sensor-01/JCTsh-remote-temp-sensor-01-phase1.md` (Phases 1–3), `components/remote-temp-sensor-01/remote-temp-sensor-01-claude-code-instructions.md` (Phase 4)
**Notes:** Started 2026-07-09 as a "replicant" of front-porch-temp-sensor, diverged into a separate component once the location moved from the sheltered porch to full-sun backyard. Phases 1–4 complete. Sensors: BME280 + BH1750 + LTR-390. Power: single swappable EVE 18650 + AEDIKO charger/holder + SUNYIMA solar panel — everything on hand, zero purchases. Firmware: 5-minute wake/publish/deep-sleep cycle (continuous WiFi not viable on this solar panel — ~10x power shortfall). Sensor power gated during sleep via an on-hand BC557B PNP transistor high-side switch (substitutes for a P-FET, same CARD-0027 pattern from hiking-sensor). AEDIKO module's own quiescent current is unmeasured — bench Step 6 of the instructions doc tests it, with a TPL5111 nanopower timer as a contingent (not assumed) mitigation if it's significant. SmartThings/Google Home exposure planned; no LEDs. Deliberately scoped smaller than weather-station (CARD-0011) — no wind/rain/lightning.

**Split into two phases of work, same pattern as hiking-sensor:** the Phase 4 instructions cover only the bench electronics/firmware build (breadboard → perfboard, sensors, power switch, deep-sleep cycle, battery/solar validation). Enclosure design (real weatherproof build with a sun-shielding vent reusing hiking-sensor's louvered vent-insert pattern, plus a separate battery-access hatch) and backyard installation are deliberately deferred to a follow-on planning pass once the electronics are proven — mirrors the CARD-0009 split on hiking-sensor. Second entry in the 3D-printing backlog behind hiking-sensor's enclosure. Ready for Phase 5 (execution) when directed.

### CARD-0012 · [idea] [air-quality-monitor] Air quality monitor
**Planning docs:** `components/air-quality-monitor/JCTsh-air-quality-monitor-phase1.md` (Phases 1–3), `components/air-quality-monitor/air-quality-monitor-claude-code-instructions.md` (Phase 4)  
**Notes:** Portable clip-mounted SEN55 air quality sensor (PM1.0/2.5/4.0/10, VOC, NOx) carried on hikes alongside the hiking monitor. Phases 1–4 complete (2026-07-09). Parts confirmed on hand: SEN55, Adafruit #5964 adapter, JST GH cable — `jctsh-parts-inventory.md`'s SparkFun SEN-23715 entry was mislabeled "SEN54," corrected to reflect it's the genuine SEN55. SEN55 sensor reading uses ESPHome's native `sen5x` platform (no custom component needed there); a custom component is still needed for onboard flash logging + WiFi replay, adapted from hiking-sensor's `hiking_logger.h`. SEN55 power-gated via an on-hand BC547B NPN transistor (same substitution pattern as remote-temp-sensor-01's BC557B) — bench-tested current draw, not just calculated, in Phase 4 Step 6. Follows hiking-monitor's firmware pattern (onboard flash logging, WiFi replay, field/home mode) exactly — that pattern is field-proven (CARD-0008), and the dependency is architectural only, **not** gated by hiking-sensor's still-open enclosure (CARD-0009). Phase 3 timeout policy matches hiking-sensor but explicitly avoids inheriting CARD-0045's `wifi.ap:`/`reboot_timeout` bug. Perfboard footprint measurement and LiPo polarity check moved from Phase 2 planning blockers to Phase 4 bench steps. Clip-case enclosure (with SEN55 intake/exhaust ports — orientation guidance currently flagged low-confidence, needs re-verification) deferred to a follow-on card, same split as hiking-sensor/remote-temp-sensor-01. Ready for Phase 5 (execution) when directed.

### CARD-0013 · [idea] [van-sensors] Van sensors (indoor + outdoor)
**Planning doc:** `components/van-sensors/JCTsh-van-sensor-phase1.md`  
**Notes:** Two ESP32 ESPHome nodes for the Pleasure-Way ProMaster 3500 van. Outdoor: BME280 + LTR-390 UV + SEN55 air quality, LiPo powered. Indoor: BME280 + SCD40 CO2 + MQ-6 propane, 12V coach power. Both log to onboard flash during travel, sync to home MQTT on WiFi reconnect (home or Pixel hotspot). DS3231 RTC for accurate timestamps during extended trips. GPS correlation via GPSLogger on Pixel. Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2 (hardware selection, inventory scan, open questions resolved).

### CARD-0011 · [idea] [weather-station] Weather station
**Planning doc:** `components/weather-station/jctsh-weather-station-planning.md`  
**Notes:** Full DIY outdoor weather station — BME280 (temp/humidity/pressure), VEML6075 (UV), SI1145 (solar irradiance), SparkFun Weather Meter Kit (wind/rain), AS3935 lightning detector, DS3231 RTC, SD card backup, solar+LiPo power. Posts to Weather Underground and Google Sheets. Phase 3 (architecture) complete — MQTT topics, payload schema, SmartThings integration, and six-phase build strategy all decided. Ready for Phase 4 (Claude Code instructions) when directed. Most parts to purchase (~$227 estimated).

## Build

### CARD-0004 · [enhancement] [salt-sensor] Migrate Arduino C++ → ESPHome
**Progress (2026-07-10):** `salt-sensor.yaml` written and compiles clean (RAM 13.2%, Flash 52.3%). Direct translation of the Arduino sketch — same 15-sample-median 12h reading cycle, same MQTT topics/payloads (`jctsh/sensors/salt-sensor/data`, `/status`, `/log`), same LED state machine (GPIO2/15/4, unchanged pins), same thresholds (still owned entirely by Node-RED — flow untouched). Added a 30-min heartbeat (`.../heartbeat`) that didn't exist before, closing the gap CARD-0021 flagged (salt-sensor showing `?` on the status dashboard). `secrets.yaml` created from `secrets.h`'s values; old v3 Arduino sketch archived to `archive/salt-sensor-v3-arduino/`; `C:\esphome\salt-sensor\` flash path set up matching the other ESPHome components.

**Two real compile bugs found and fixed during translation** (both are ESPHome `globals:` gotchas, not obvious from the docs): a fixed-size C array global (`float[15]`) fails to compile (`GlobalsComponent` can't take an array by value — decays to a pointer); switched to `std::vector<float>`. Its `initial_value: '{}'` was then ambiguous between two constructor overloads; fixed with an explicit `std::vector<float>()` initializer.

**One design decision worth flagging:** ESPHome's default MQTT birth topic is `<topic_prefix>/status`, which would have silently collided with this component's existing `.../status` topic (Node-RED → ESP32, drives the LEDs). `birth_message:` is explicitly disabled in the yaml to prevent this — a real footgun for any future component whose topic convention includes `/status`.

**Don't close until:** flashed via USB (must be physically connected — OTA can't push onto a device still running the old Arduino/ArduinoOTA firmware) and field-verified — LED self-test visible, `/data` publishes a real reading, `/status` round-trips correctly and drives the LEDs, `/heartbeat` shows up on the watchdog wildcard. Sensor doesn't need to be connected for the flash itself to succeed, only for verifying the reading pipeline.

### CARD-0043 · [bug] [photo-server] Robin's library missing metadata (null width/height/orientation) for large fraction of assets
**Notes:** Discovered 2026-07-09 following up on CARD-0042 — Joseph reported a specific HEIC photo (`IMG_20260625_165423.heic`, Robin's account) with a fine-looking thumbnail but a visibly distorted full image (elongated heads). Checked the asset directly via `/api/assets/{id}`: `width`, `height`, `exifImageWidth`, `exifImageHeight`, and `orientation` all `null` — Immich never successfully extracted this file's real dimensions/orientation, which plausibly explains the distortion (wrong aspect-ratio assumption during preview rendering). Sampled 100 assets per account: **Joseph 0/100 null width; Robin 89/100 (89%)** — same lopsided pattern as CARD-0037/CARD-0039/CARD-0042, again far worse for Robin despite her "clean" import history.

Triggered `metadataExtraction` via `PUT /api/jobs/metadataExtraction` (`{"command":"start"}`) — unlike CARD-0042's thumbnail gap, this one *is* partially caught by the normal queue trigger: 13,311 assets queued immediately. However this is likely not the full picture — some assets (like the specific HEIC file that started this) may be marked "complete" in the database despite holding null values, the same DB-vs-reality mismatch pattern as CARD-0042, which would need the same forced per-asset fix (`refresh-metadata`, another valid job name on the same `/api/assets/jobs` endpoint used for CARD-0042's `regenerate-thumbnail`).

**Paused here by design (2026-07-09):** M8 load hit 12.64/12 cores with CARD-0030's backup, CARD-0042's thumbnail regen, and this metadata extraction all running concurrently — Immich API was still responsive (45ms ping) so nothing was failing, but Joseph asked to let the current jobs finish before adding a full forced `refresh-metadata` sweep across Robin's ~77,123 assets. The 13,311 already queued will keep processing in the background regardless.

**Don't close until:** (1) the initially-triggered 13,311 finish processing, (2) a forced `refresh-metadata` sweep runs across Robin's full library the same way CARD-0042's thumbnail fix did, (3) the specific `IMG_20260625_165423.heic` asset is re-checked and confirmed to have real width/height/orientation values and correct (non-distorted) display, (4) a fresh sample check shows Robin's null-width rate back in line with Joseph's (0%).

---

### CARD-0042 · [bug] [photo-server] Robin's library missing thumbnails for ~81% of assets
**Notes:** Discovered 2026-07-09 while troubleshooting Robin's phone backup — Joseph noticed "Error Loading Image" on several thumbnails, both in the phone's local gallery view and (critically) in the web UI too, which ruled out a phone-side rendering glitch. Diagnosed via direct HTTP checks against `/api/assets/{id}/thumbnail`: a 150-asset sample came back 122/150 (81%) returning `404` for Robin, versus **0/150** for Joseph — confirmed real, server-side, and isolated to Robin's account. Root cause not pinned down (her import was the "clean" one per `migration.md`, yet has by far the worse thumbnail gap — consistent with the same pattern already seen in CARD-0037/CARD-0039 where Robin's account had the larger gap despite the cleaner import history). The standard `thumbnailGeneration` job queue didn't surface these (`waiting: 1` when triggered normally) because Immich's database already considered them complete — the gap is between DB state and actual thumbnail files on disk, not a "job never ran" situation like CARD-0037.

**Fix:** used the per-asset job endpoint (`POST /api/assets/jobs`, `{"name":"regenerate-thumbnail","assetIds":[...]}` — found via the same schema-discovery trick as CARD-0037/CARD-0039, sending an invalid body and reading the validation error's allowed values) to force-regenerate every one of Robin's 77,123 assets in 155 batches of 500. Confirmed working on a small scale first (9 known-broken assets, all fixed, verified via HTTP 200) before committing to the full-library run. Submitted successfully in full — `thumbnailGeneration` queue confirmed at 76,996 waiting immediately after. Verified live at every step (new photo from Robin's phone arrived with a working thumbnail, confirming upload itself was never broken — only historical thumbnails were affected).

Running concurrently with CARD-0030's backup verification and the tail end of CARD-0037/039's work; checked M8 load before committing to the bulk job (5.04/12 cores, comfortable).

**Don't close until:** `thumbnailGeneration` queue drains to 0 waiting/active with 0 failed, and a fresh sample check (same method as the diagnosis) shows Robin's thumbnail success rate back in line with Joseph's (0% broken).

---

### CARD-0030 · [bug] [photo-server] Re-enable weekly backup cron once Takeout zips are cleared
**Progress (2026-07-09):** Zips deleted (818GB reclaimed: Momentus 100%→19% used, NVMe root 87%→5% used — see `components/photo-server/backup.md`). Cron re-enabled and confirmed uncommented.

**Verification run failed (2026-07-10):** the manual verification run kicked off 2026-07-09 ran overnight and failed — `rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (code 23)` after `No space left on device`. The primary library had grown to 624GB, genuinely too large for Momentus (586GB usable) to ever hold — not a slow-first-run situation as assumed, a real capacity ceiling. See DEVLOG.md 2026-07-10 for the full incident (wrong spare drive connected first, neither spare was actually blank, a jostled connector caused a real hardware I/O failure on Momentus mid-swap — recovered cleanly, no data loss).

**Fix: split backup by account across two drives** (see `components/photo-server/backup.md` for full detail). Deployed a second backup drive (Seagate 1TB, formatted, mounted at `/mnt/photo-library-backup-joseph`) and rewrote `photo-library-backup.sh` to run two filtered `rsync` jobs — Joseph's account to the new drive, Robin's to Momentus.

**Two more rsync flag bugs found and fixed before it actually worked (2026-07-10):** the split jobs initially failed to clean up Momentus at all — plain `--delete` doesn't remove files matched by `--exclude` (a protective rsync default), so Joseph's stale files just sat there across two attempts. Fixed with `--delete-excluded`, plus `--delete-before` to avoid a separate directory-walk-order deadlock. Full detail in `backup.md`.

**Robin's job: confirmed complete and clean** — Momentus dropped from 556G to 207G (matching her ~187GB actual usage) with zero errors.

**Joseph's job: in progress** — was interrupted mid-transfer at 47G while troubleshooting the container bind-mount incident (see below), resumed with the corrected script.

**Don't close until:** Joseph's rsync job completes with exit 0, and `df -h /mnt/photo-library-backup-joseph` shows used space roughly matching his actual usage (~403GB).

### CARD-0040 · [enhancement] [photo-server] Dashboard visibility for backup runs
**Notes:** Following the same pattern as CARD-0036 (reboot notifications), `photo-library-backup.sh` (`components/photo-server/photo-library-backup.sh`, deployed to `/usr/local/bin/`) now publishes MQTT log messages so backup success/failure is visible on the JCTsh log dashboard without SSHing in: `"Backup starting."` before rsync, `"Backup complete."` (category `System`) on success, or `"Backup failed (rsync exit <code>)."` (category `Alert`, non-collapsing) on failure. Uses the existing `photo-server` MQTT account and `mosquitto_pub`, already installed for the reboot-notification work — no new credentials.

**Not yet live-verified** — deployed while the first post-cleanup backup run (started under the old script version) was still in progress, so it hasn't fired for real yet. Don't close until the next run (manual trigger or next Sunday's cron) is confirmed showing both messages on the dashboard, paired with CARD-0030's verification above.

### CARD-0009 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Enclosure design and build
**Notes:** Design and build the permanent enclosure. Field prototype (two-board sandwich) documented in `components/hiking-sensor/enclosure-prototype.md`. Standoffs arrive 2026-06-14; temp enclosure build before camping trip departure 2026-06-15. Device will be used in the field for ~2 weeks on that trip — hiking and van sensor simulation. Full 3D-printed permanent enclosure is a later step.

### CARD-0048 · [bug] [photo-server] Stale Immich container bind mount after drive remounts — "Error loading image" on both accounts
**Resolution:** Discovered 2026-07-10 when Joseph reported "beaucoup" thumbnail and full-image load failures on his account, then confirmed Robin had the same issue. Initial theory (I/O contention from the actively-running backup rsync) was wrong — killing the backup didn't fix anything. Root cause: the `immich_server` container's bind mount had gone stale after the day's repeated remounting (read-only, I/O errors, primary library's device path changing `sda`→`sdd`). Confirmed via a specific 404ing asset: the file was genuinely present on disk with correct content, ruling out real data loss — the container just had a broken cached view of the mount. The storage-health check (CARD-0032) had actually been correctly alerting on this the whole time (recurring `Input/output error` every 30-minute cycle for 2+ hours) — the miss was diagnostic, not detection; time was spent chasing the wrong theory first.

**Fix:** `docker compose restart` (all four containers) from `~/immich-app`. Verified immediately: every previously-404ing asset (thumbnail and original) on both accounts returned to `200`. Also confirmed by Joseph directly in the Immich web UI on both accounts.

Runbook note added to `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md`: if storage alerts recur across multiple heartbeat cycles (not just once), especially after any drive remount/unplug/replug event, check the container's actual data access first — a clean host-side mount does not guarantee the running container is looking at it correctly.

---

### CARD-0047 · [enhancement] [photo-server] Daily Immich update-availability check with dashboard notification
**Resolution:** Joseph noticed an Immich update available in the web UI and asked how to manage updates going forward — discussed and agreed on notify-only (not auto-update), given this instance has already surfaced real bugs in a single patch version this week (CARD-0037/0042/0043, the HEIC distortion issue) and the data at stake (irreplaceable family photos) doesn't justify unattended auto-updates.

Built `immich-update-check.py` (deployed to `/usr/local/bin/`) + `immich-update-check.service`/`.timer` (daily, 6:00 AM `America/Phoenix`), following the same MQTT dashboard-notification pattern as CARD-0036/CARD-0040: compares `/api/server/version` against `/api/server/version-check`, publishes `"Immich update available: <latest> (currently running <current>)"` (component `photo-server`, category `System`) when they differ. De-duplicated via a state file so the same pending update doesn't re-notify daily — only fires again if an even newer version appears after the first notice.

First deploy attempt crashed on the state-file write (`/etc/jctsh/` isn't writable by the `jct` user, appropriately, since it holds credentials) — moved the state file to `/home/jct/.jctsh/` and added `os.makedirs`. Verified live 2026-07-10: first corrected run notified correctly (`v3.0.2` vs. running `v3.0.1`), confirmed on the dashboard; second run correctly skipped re-notifying for the same version. Added to `jctsh-network.md`'s Scheduled Maintenance Windows table (6:00 AM daily, no conflicts with existing jobs). Actual update application remains a deliberate manual step, not automated.

### CARD-0022 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Security hardening — infrastructure audit (Steps 1–8)
**Resolution:** All 8 steps complete. Steps 1–5 and 8 passed clean or were fixed on 2026-06-20 (SSH key-only auth, MQTT auth, port audit, Node-RED adminAuth). Step 7 (HA MFA) done 2026-07-09: TOTP enabled for both Joseph and Robin via HA profile → Multi-Factor Authentication Modules. Step 6 (router UPnP) done 2026-07-09: found enabled with zero registered clients, disabled with no functional impact. Full findings in `jctsh-security-hardening.md`. Patterns harvested to `JCTsh-Build-Standards.md` §10 Security Standards (v1.14).

### CARD-0023 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Security hardening — cloud accounts (Steps 9–14 + Final)
**Resolution:** All steps complete. Steps 9–12 and 14 passed clean 2026-06-20 (Ring/Amazon, SmartThings, Google ×2, Windows machine — one stale SmartThings connected app, SharpTools, revoked). Step 13 done 2026-07-09: router admin password rotated to a new strong unique password (`credentials.local.md`), remote/WAN management confirmed disabled, DNS confirmed intentional (CenturyLink/Quantum Fiber bypass-modem setup), firmware found one version behind (1.5.2 → 1.5.3 available) with auto-update now enabled (nightly 3–5 AM) rather than relying on manual checks going forward. Final Step complete: findings harvested to `JCTsh-Build-Standards.md` §10 Security Standards (v1.14).

### CARD-0039 · [bug] [photo-server] Re-verify Takeout import completeness — 3,433 assets were genuinely missing
**Resolution:** Following up on the original migration verification discussion, and given CARD-0037 had just found a large ML-processing gap from the same import, re-ran `immich-go upload from-google-photos` (real run, not `--dry-run`, so gaps found would get fixed immediately) against all retained Takeout zips for both accounts — `/mnt/photo-library-backup/takeout-staging/joseph/` (9 zips), `/home/jct/takeout-staging/joseph/` (3 zips), `/home/jct/takeout-staging/robin/` (5 zips). Used the same `--on-errors continue --pause-immich-jobs=false` flags that fixed the original migration's crash patterns, plus `--no-ui --log-file=...` this time for a persisted per-pass log (a gap in the original run). Launched fully detached via `nohup ... & disown` directly on the M8 so it survived independent of the SSH session — relevant since the home internet/network was intermittently down around this time.

**Result:** ran clean in a single pass, no restarts needed, zero upload errors. Found **3,433 assets that were genuinely missing** from Immich and uploaded them (zero data loss risk — upload-only, nothing deleted): 58 (Joseph, backup-drive zips), 119 (Joseph, NVMe-staged zips), 3,256 (Robin). Also found 109 cases where the server's copy was upgraded (better-quality version found in the zip) and 160,701 correctly-matching duplicates confirmed (skipped, no re-upload).

**Notable finding:** Robin's pass had by far the largest gap (3,256 missing) despite her original import being documented as the "clean" one with no crashes/restarts (see `components/photo-server/migration.md`) — this means the missing-asset gap was not caused solely by Joseph's chaotic 5-restart import as originally assumed. Combined with CARD-0037's finding that Robin's ML-processing gap was also worse than Joseph's (96% vs ~80% zero-face rate), there's a consistent pattern that something affected both imports similarly regardless of which one crashed — most likely some shared infrastructure/timing factor from both multi-day imports running through the same M8 around the same period. Root cause not further investigated since the fix (re-run to catch anything missing) resolves it regardless of cause, same reasoning as CARD-0037.

Full run logs retained on the M8 at `/home/jct/immich-go-verify-20260709/` (`joseph-backup.log`, `joseph-home.log`, `robin.log`, `run.out`).

### CARD-0032 · [bug] [photo-server] Heartbeat doesn't detect real storage failures (found 2026-07-08)
**Resolution:** `photo-server-heartbeat.py` now writes, reads back, and removes a marker file (`/data/upload/.heartbeat_check`) *inside* the `immich_server` container on every run where the container itself is confirmed up, catching the exact class of failure Docker's own health check misses (it only pings the Immich API, never touches `/data`). A failure is appended to the same `unhealthy` list and reported as `Alert - storage:<error text>`, using the identical non-collapsing path CARD-0029 established for degraded containers. Immediate fix (remount, container restart) and root-cause mitigation (udev auto-remount rule) from the original incident were already in place; this closes the actual monitoring gap.

Live-tested 2026-07-08 by remounting `/mnt/photo-library` read-only (`mount -o remount,ro`) — chosen over physically disconnecting the drive, and over a plain `chmod` on the host-side directory (tried first; silently didn't work, since the container runs as root and root bypasses POSIX permission bits — a read-only remount is enforced at the VFS level instead). Dashboard correctly showed `Immich degraded - storage:sh: 1: cannot create /data/upload/.heartbeat_check: Read-only file system`; remounting read-write restored normal status on the next run. Full writeup in `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md`.

**Still unknown:** the original root physical cause of the USB drive disconnecting in the first place (no clear `dmesg` evidence was captured at the time). Worth checking/reseating the USB cable and capturing full `dmesg` as root if it recurs — not blocking, since the monitoring gap that made it dangerous is now closed.

---

### CARD-0029 · [enhancement] [photo-server] Live-test Immich degraded-heartbeat alert path
**Resolution:** Live-tested 2026-07-08 now that the Immich migration is complete. `docker stop immich_redis` produced `Immich degraded - immich_redis:unhealthy` (then `:starting` during the restart race) as a non-collapsing `Alert` row on the dashboard; `docker start immich_redis` restored normal `System`/online status on the next run. Combined with the CARD-0032 storage-check test in the same session. Full writeup in `components/photo-server/heartbeat.md`.

---

### CARD-0036 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Dashboard visibility for scheduled reboots
**Resolution:** CARD-0035's scheduled reboots were invisible on the JCTsh log dashboard — confirming success required manually SSHing in and checking `systemctl`/`docker ps`. Added a matched pair of MQTT log messages around each reboot: `scheduled-reboot.service` now publishes `"Scheduled reboot about to occur."` immediately before calling `/sbin/reboot` (multiple `ExecStart=` lines in the oneshot unit), and a new `reboot-complete.service` (enabled via `WantedBy=multi-user.target`) publishes `"Boot complete."` on every boot once the MQTT broker is reachable. Pi publishes as component `jctsh-core` to `jctsh/core/log-server/log` using the existing `jctsh-log-server` MQTT account (`/etc/jctsh/log-server.env`) via `mosquitto_pub` (already installed). M8 publishes as component `photo-server` to `jctsh/server/photo-server/log` using the existing `photo-server` MQTT account (`/etc/jctsh/heartbeat.env`) — required installing the `mosquitto-clients` apt package on the M8 (the heartbeat script uses Python `paho-mqtt` instead, so the CLI wasn't already present). Neither message uses the `"Heartbeat - "` prefix, so each occurrence stays visible as its own dashboard row rather than collapsing. Per-host unit files split out: `scheduled-reboot-pi.service`/`scheduled-reboot-m8.service` replace the old shared `scheduled-reboot.service` (now host-specific since the MQTT broker address, credentials file, and topic differ per host). Verified live 2026-07-08 via manual `systemctl start reboot-complete.service` on both hosts — confirmed on the dashboard (`/data` live view and, after flushing, the persisted `/log` file).

### CARD-0037 · [bug] [photo-server] ML processing (faces, smart search, duplicates, OCR) never ran on a large fraction of the library
**Resolution:** Discovered 2026-07-08 while answering Joseph's question about why most photos showed no identified people in Properties. Diagnosed via the Immich API (not guesswork): a random sample showed ~80% of assets with zero detected faces; a targeted CLIP-search sample of clearly-portrait photos still showed clean detection (26/30 correct), ruling out a model-confidence issue. Definitive proof came from a duplicate pair — the exact same restaurant photo (Immich's own duplicate-detection linked the two copies) had 7 faces detected on one copy and 0 on the other.

**Not specific to Joseph's chaotic import:** checked Robin's library too (via her own API key, since search is scoped per-user) — 96% zero-face rate, even higher than Joseph's ~80%, despite her import running clean with no crashes/restarts (see `components/photo-server/migration.md`). This ruled out the 5-restart-import theory as the sole cause and confirmed the gap was server-wide, affecting both accounts roughly equally.

**Fix:** triggered all five affected ML jobs (`faceDetection`, `facialRecognition`, `smartSearch`, `ocr`, `duplicateDetection`) via `PUT /api/jobs/{name}` (`{"command":"start"}`) — Immich has no dry-run mode, so starting each job was simultaneously the diagnostic (revealing real backlogs: ~140,000 for faces, 33,201 for duplicates, ~17,000 each for smartSearch/OCR) and the fix. Checked load average and `vmstat` before/during (CPU-bound at ~60% user time, only 3-7% iowait — not I/O-bound, plenty of headroom on the 12-core M8) to confirm it was safe to run all five concurrently.

**Confirmed complete 2026-07-09** (ran overnight, unaffected by an unrelated home-internet outage since the jobs run locally on the M8): all five queues back to 0 waiting/active, 0 failed for the entire run. M8 uptime at completion check was 19h36m — never rebooted, confirming genuine completion rather than a state reset. Total people clusters grew 2,626 → 3,331 (+705) as full coverage let previously-under-threshold clusters (`minFaces: 3`) surface. Final spot-check: the `868900f1` duplicate that started the whole investigation at 0 faces now shows all 7, with Joseph and Robin correctly matched by name. `duplicateDetection` found 2,197 duplicate groups total once it had full coverage — worth a manual review pass in the Duplicates view when convenient, not urgent.

### CARD-0035 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Weekly scheduled reboot — Pi and M8 photo-server
**Resolution:** Deployed systemd timers on both hosts: `scheduled-reboot.timer` → `scheduled-reboot.service` (`/sbin/reboot`), `Persistent=true`. Pi: Monday 3:00 AM. M8: Monday 4:00 AM — staggered one hour later so the M8 heartbeat script's MQTT publish to the Pi's Mosquitto broker doesn't collide with the Pi being mid-reboot. Not synchronized to KeepConnect's own weekly router reset — that schedule has drifted from its original Wednesday setting, most likely because its "every 7 days" timer restarts from any reset (scheduled or outage-triggered), so it can't be relied on as a fixed weekday anyway; a router reboot's brief network blip is tolerated regardless of timing. Version-controlled unit files in `core/maintenance/`; documented in `SOFTWARE-ENVIRONMENT.md` (Pi) and new `components/photo-server/operations.md` (M8). Verified live via `systemctl list-timers` on both hosts — next run confirmed Mon 2026-07-13. 2026-07-08.

### CARD-0033 · [idea] [infrastructure] Document Keep Connect configuration and schedule
**Resolution:** KeepConnect is a standalone router-rebooter device (Johnson Creative KeepConnect-27F8, not a JCTsh component). New dedicated doc `keepconnect.md` created at repo root with full device identity, network config, physical outlet-scoping rationale, and complete monitor/timing/schedule/notification configuration. Linked from `jctsh-network.md` devices table (IP 192.168.1.108, DHCP-reserved) and `ENVIRONMENT.md` Hub & Controller table; added to `README.md` repository layout. Remaining open item (scheduled Pi/Immich reboot via cron, separate from power-strip cycling) carried forward in `keepconnect.md` itself. 2026-07-08.

### CARD-0021 · [enhancement] [logging] Device status dashboard
**Resolution:** Added `/status` endpoint to `core/logging/log_server.py`. Two-section layout: Home (Online/Offline/? per component based on heartbeat presence and 70-min threshold) and Remote (`coachproxyos` always shows last-activity + `?`). Auto-detects heartbeat-capable components — salt-sensor shows `?` until CARD-0004 ESPHome migration adds heartbeats. Deployed to Pi 2026-06-30. Added CARD-0024 (coachproxy remote health monitoring via Tailscale ping).

### CARD-0018 · [idea] [immich] Self-hosted photo library
**Resolution:** Superseded. Hardware (GMKtec M8) in hand. Replaced by `components/photo-server/` (Immich install + immich-go migration) and `components/photo-tv-display/` (Node.js TV slideshow + phone companion) — full planning docs committed 2026-06-30.

### CARD-0014 · [enhancement] [core] Move environmental data pipeline to core
**Resolution:** Moved `environmental-data.gs` → `core/data-pipeline/`, `JCTsh-Environmental-Data-Architecture.md` → `core/data-pipeline/`, and `core/node-red/environmental-data.flow.json` → `core/data-pipeline/`. Updated references across 15 files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, Node-RED-workflow.md, JCTsh-Build-Standards.md, JCTsh-Component-Planning-Pattern.md, JCTsh-Property-Sensor-Pattern.md, all component planning docs, hiking-sensor instructions). 2026-06-30.

### CARD-0002 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] MQTT v3.1.1 → v5 upgrade
**Resolution:** Mosquitto 2.0.21 already supports v5 — no broker config change needed. Changed `protocolVersion` from 4 → 5 in the Node-RED broker config node (`core/node-red/core.flow.json`) and updated the live Pi flows.json in place. Confirmed via Mosquitto log: client `nodered-saltlevel` connected with `p5`. ESP32/ESPHome devices unaffected (remain on v3.1.1). 2026-06-30.

### CARD-0008 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Pixel hotspot second WiFi field test
**Notes:** Confirmed 2026-06-17 during camping trip. Device connected to JCT Hotspot (IP 10.57.172.159 — Pixel hotspot subnet), reached home MQTT broker via jctsh.duckdns.org over cellular, replayed 7 SPIFFS readings on reconnect. DuckDNS + port 1883 forward confirmed working in the field.

### CARD-0017 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Charging state schema fields for solar/battery sensors
**Resolution:** Added `solar_v` (solar panel voltage, V, ADC voltage divider) to the environmental data schema. Decision: `solar_v` chosen over `charging` boolean (not universally available on all charge controllers) and `charge_current_ma` (requires INA219, overkill). Combined with `battery_v`, charging state is derivable in Node-RED or Sheets as `solar_v > battery_v + ~0.3V`. Added to field reference and Sheets schema in `JCTsh-Environmental-Data-Architecture.md` (v1.4), column Z in `components/hiking-sensor/environmental-data.gs`, and Apps Script redeployed. 2026-06-15.

### CARD-0016 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Offline flash logging — extract reusable standard
**Resolution:** Created `core/offline-logger/sensor_logger.h` — generic template header with `sensor_log_*` function prefix (adapt by renaming to `<name>_log_*` and updating the log file path). Added "Offline Flash Logging" section to `JCTsh-Property-Sensor-Pattern.md` with template adaptation instructions, on_boot mount snippet, on_connect replay block (500ms settle delay), and interval guard (connected → publish, offline → log_write). Removed CARD-0016 from pattern doc Open Gaps. 2026-06-14.

### CARD-0015 · [enhancement] [front-porch-temp-sensor] Environmental data pipeline integration
**Resolution:** Added SNTP, humidity/pressure IDs, and 5-min `/data` publish to firmware (temp, humidity, pressure, illuminance, lat/lon H8, rssi, ISO 8601 UTC). Added `illuminance_lx` to the environmental data schema and Apps Script. Node-RED wildcard caught it automatically — no flow changes. OTA flashed 2026-06-14.
