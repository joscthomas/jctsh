## Backlog

### CARD-002 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] MQTT v3.1.1 → v5 upgrade
**Notes:** Node-RED v4 creates MQTT In/Out nodes with v5 fields (nl, rap, respTopic, etc.) that silently break on the v3.1.1 broker — requires manual cleanup after every UI import. Mosquitto 2.x supports v5 and is backward-compatible with v3 clients, so ESP32/ESPHome devices stay on v3 unmodified. Steps: verify Mosquitto version, enable v5 in mosquitto.conf if needed, change Node-RED broker node protocolVersion from 4 to 5, test all existing flows. Do as a standalone maintenance task — not mid-component-build.

---

### CARD-003 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] TLS for Mosquitto (port 8883)
**Notes:** Port 1883 is internet-exposed via DuckDNS/port-forward with fail2ban, but credentials and sensor data are cleartext. TLS on port 8883 eliminates this. Steps: get Let's Encrypt cert for the DuckDNS hostname (certbot with duckdns plugin), add a TLS listener on port 8883 in mosquitto.conf, update mqtt_broker port in every ESPHome secrets.yaml, update Node-RED broker node, update HA MQTT integration, reflash all ESP32s. Do as a standalone task after DuckDNS setup is stable. Depends on CARD-002 being done first (or do together).

---

### CARD-004 · [enhancement] [salt-sensor] Migrate Arduino C++ → ESPHome
**Notes:** Do this before perfboard transfer — ESPHome initializes hardware differently than Arduino and if a strapping pin causes a boot issue it's easier to rewire on breadboard than cut perfboard traces. Device side maps cleanly (ultrasonic platform, median filter, 12h interval, LED blink via globals). Hard part: test mode needs redesign — Node-RED currently injects fake readings; ESPHome has no equivalent. Replace with an HA script that triggers the threshold automation with a synthetic distance value. GPIO 2 and 15 are strapping pins but currently working — not a blocker.

---

### CARD-005 · [enhancement] [p-w-firefly] Overlay filesystem
**Notes:** The Pi in the RV runs continuously, accumulating writes from logs, Tailscale state, and OS housekeeping — SD cards have a finite write cycle life and will eventually fail silently. An overlay filesystem makes the SD card effectively read-only during normal operation: all writes go to RAM, the card is only written during a deliberate shutdown sequence.

**Tailscale complication:** Tailscale stores its node identity and keys in `/var/lib/tailscale/`. If that directory is in the overlay (RAM-only), Tailscale loses its identity on every reboot and needs to re-authenticate. Fix: a persistent bind mount (small USB stick or dedicated partition) mapped to `/var/lib/tailscale/` so it survives reboots.

**eRVin image complication:** Raspbian Buster's modified `raspi-config` does not expose the overlay option in its UI — must be set up manually with `bilibop-lockfs` or equivalent.

**Interim protection:** SanDisk MAX Endurance card already installed.

---

### CARD-014 · [enhancement] [core] Move environmental data pipeline to core
**Notes:** The environmental data pipeline (Apps Script, Google Sheets, Node-RED wildcard data handler) is shared infrastructure consumed by all sensor components — not owned by hiking-sensor. All data flowing through it is environmental data, including observations. Move `environmental-data.gs`, `JCTsh-Environmental-Data-Architecture.md`, and the Node-RED wildcard data handler flow to `core/data-pipeline/`. Update references in component directories. Do before the system grows significantly — weather station, air quality monitor, and van sensors will all be consumers.

---

### CARD-006 · [enhancement] [logging] Move log directory to USB stick
**Priority:** low  
**Notes:** Move LOG_DIR in log_server.py from the SD card to a USB stick plugged into the Pi for better write endurance. Add an /etc/fstab entry so it auto-mounts at boot before the jctsh-logging service starts.

---

### CARD-019 · [idea] [vu-meter] Home theater VU meters
**Notes:** VU meter displays for home theater speakers — Left, Right, Center, Subwoofer (4 channels). Circuit to be breadboarded first to validate the analog front end before any JCTsh integration work begins.

**Hardware:**
- One ESP32 for all 4 channels — GPIO32/33/34/35 are all ADC1 pins and don't conflict with WiFi
- Display: WS2812B addressable RGB LED strips (color gradient green→yellow→red, software-configurable). Alternatives considered: discrete LEDs, OLED, LED matrix, NeoPixel rings
- Sub input: tap AV receiver RCA (line-level, ~1–2V peak) if powered sub — much simpler than speaker level. Speaker-level tap if passive sub

**Analog front-end circuit (per channel — speaker level):**
- High-side resistor divider ≥100kΩ to avoid loading the amp (speaker load is 4–8Ω; parallel impedance must stay negligible)
- Full-wave rectifier + peak detector capacitor — converts bipolar AC audio signal to positive DC level proportional to loudness
- 10kΩ series resistor before each ADC pin
- Schottky or TVS clamping diodes at ADC pin (to GND and 3.3V) — protect against transients and voltage excursions
- Keep resistor power dissipation in check: at 20V across 100kΩ = 4mW, well within ¼W rating

**Protection concerns:**
- Impedance loading: high-side ≥100kΩ ensures microamp draw; receiver can't tell it's there
- Voltage: speaker level can reach 20–30V peak — divider must scale to 0–3.3V; audio is bipolar so rectification is required before ADC
- Transients: amp spikes at power-on/off — clamping diodes + series resistor handle this
- Ground loops: ESP32 USB ground may differ from audio system ground → 60Hz hum injected into audio. Mitigation: isolated USB wall adapter, high-value sense resistors, or optical isolation (most robust)
- RF noise: ESP32 WiFi radiates RF — keep sense wiring physically separated from speaker cables; consider shielding

**JCTsh smart integration:**
- MQTT topics: `jctsh/components/vu-meter/data` (levels), `jctsh/components/vu-meter/log`, `jctsh/components/vu-meter/cmd` (remote control)
- Publish: per-channel audio level, `is_playing` boolean (derived from threshold + 1s hold)
- Node-RED: detect play/stop transitions → dim/restore theater lighting, turn off AV receiver after N min silence, notify if audio playing after midnight
- Remote display control via cmd topic: brightness, color scheme, sensitivity — adjustable from phone without touching hardware
- Optional: level logging to Google Sheets

**Division of labor:**
- Claude writes: ESPHome YAML (ADC reading, peak detection, WS2812B driving), MQTT schema, Node-RED flows, HA entities
- Physical validation: breadboard analog front end, measure actual output voltage range at typical listening volume, then tune firmware divider constants to match

**Resources:** No single tutorial covers this full stack. Pieces: Hackaday/Instructables (VU meter projects, WS2812B), Andreas Spiess YouTube (ESP32 audio/ADC), EEVblog forums or r/diyelectronics (circuit review before connecting to real equipment), ESPHome docs (firmware). Speaker-level input with proper protection is under-documented — this is an original design.

**Next step:** Breadboard and validate the analog front-end circuit. Measure voltage range at the ADC pin at low, medium, and high listening volumes. Report back before firmware work begins.

### CARD-018 · [idea] [immich] Self-hosted photo library
**Notes:** Migrate Google Photos → Immich (self-hosted). Migration path: Google Takeout export → immich-go to upload to Immich instance including albums. Going forward: Immich mobile app on Pixel as backup destination instead of (or alongside) Google Photos. Periodic re-import via Takeout to catch anything new. Robin's photos need a separate Takeout + import pass. Direct API sync tools (gphotos-sync) stopped working March 2025 when Google restricted OAuth scopes — Takeout + immich-go is now the standard path.

**Hardware decision:** Intel N100 mini PC (Beelink EQ12 Pro or GMKtec M6 — ~$150–180, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD). Hardware QuickSync transcoding, fast ML indexing (~1–2s/photo), 10–15W idle, Docker install. Storage: existing USB drives (sizes TBD).

**Phase 2 — Ambient display app:** TV slideshow (web app in TV browser) + phone companion page. Server-side highlights algorithm: recency bias, exclude blurry/low-quality, no repeat within N days, short video support with max-duration cutoff. Phone companion shows current photo thumbnail with one-tap Delete / Favorite / Add to album via WebSocket. Enhancements over Google TV: filter by person (Immich face recognition), seasonal mode, "this week in history" mixing recent + same week past years. Runs as Node.js Docker service on N100 alongside Immich. Plan in a dedicated session once Immich is running.

### CARD-010 · [enhancement] [front-porch-temp-sensor] Use case definition
**Notes:** Perfboard transfer complete. No enclosure planned. Sensor publishes temp, humidity, pressure, illuminance every 5 min. Perfboard layout: `components/front-porch-temp-sensor/perfboard-layout.md`.

Existing automations: Temp Alert (above threshold+2°F for 10 min) and Temp Dropping (below threshold−2°F for 10 min). Threshold: `input_number.front_porch_temp_threshold` (currently 90°F).

**Candidate use cases:**

**Pre-cooling alert** — temp dropping fast in the evening signals a good time to open windows. Node-RED computes rate of change; notify when drop exceeds X°F in Y minutes after sunset.

**Morning warm-up alert** — temp rising rapidly; close windows before the house heats up.

**Frost likelihood** — frost in the Arizona desert is rare but nuanced.

*Two mechanisms:*
- **Frozen dew** — dew (liquid) forms first when air temp drops to the dew point, then freezes if temp continues below 32°F. Requires dew point above 32°F. Rare in the desert.
- **Deposition frost** — water vapor deposits directly as ice, skipping the liquid phase entirely. This is the relevant type for the Arizona desert, where dew point is almost always below 32°F in winter. Governed by the **frost point** (a separate value from dew point, slightly higher than dew point at sub-freezing temperatures — meaning deposition frost can form at a higher temperature than liquid dew would).

*What matters for the sensor:*
- Dew point already computed by Node-RED from temp + humidity
- Frost point derivable from same inputs via a Node-RED function node
- Radiative cooling on clear nights (illuminance near zero = clear sky proxy) can drop surface temps 5–7°F below air temp — frost on surfaces can occur at 36–38°F air temp in still, clear conditions
- *Frost risk index*: notify when air temp < 38°F AND frost point < 32°F AND nighttime (illuminance ~0)

*Hiking sensor connection:*
Trail elevation makes frost far more likely than at home — the Santa Catalinas rise from ~2,500 ft (Tucson) to 9,000+ ft, roughly 3.5°F cooler per 1,000 ft of gain (~23°F colder at the summit). The hiking sensor measures actual temp and humidity at trail elevation, so it has everything needed to compute dew point and frost point in the field. Two integration points:
- **E-ink display** — add frost point or a frost risk indicator to the display when temp is below a threshold (currently shows temp, humidity, pressure trend, UV, battery)
- **Replay pipeline** — after a hike, the archived temp/humidity records correlated with the GPS track show where on the trail frost conditions existed, for future planning
- **Hike selection** — frost conditions at home (front porch sensor) combined with known elevation lapse rate could inform which trail to choose. If overnight low at 2,500 ft was 42°F, frost point was 28°F, and a trail peaks at 7,000 ft, surface frost is likely above ~5,500 ft. This becomes a reason to seek out a higher-elevation hike specifically to experience frost conditions in the desert.

**UV alert** — LTR-390 already reports UV index. Notify when UV index exceeds a threshold (e.g., 6+) for outdoor activity or plant protection planning.

**Plant protection reminder** — when frost risk is non-zero, notify to cover sensitive plants. Seasonal (December–February in Tucson).

## Done

### CARD-008 · [enhancement] [hiking-sensor] Pixel hotspot second WiFi field test
**Notes:** Confirmed 2026-06-17 during camping trip. Device connected to JCT Hotspot (IP 10.57.172.159 — Pixel hotspot subnet), reached home MQTT broker via jctsh.duckdns.org over cellular, replayed 7 SPIFFS readings on reconnect. DuckDNS + port 1883 forward confirmed working in the field.

---

### CARD-017 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Charging state schema fields for solar/battery sensors
**Resolution:** Added `solar_v` (solar panel voltage, V, ADC voltage divider) to the environmental data schema. Decision: `solar_v` chosen over `charging` boolean (not universally available on all charge controllers) and `charge_current_ma` (requires INA219, overkill). Combined with `battery_v`, charging state is derivable in Node-RED or Sheets as `solar_v > battery_v + ~0.3V`. Added to field reference and Sheets schema in `JCTsh-Environmental-Data-Architecture.md` (v1.4), column Z in `components/hiking-sensor/environmental-data.gs`, and Apps Script redeployed. 2026-06-15.

---

### CARD-016 · [enhancement] [infrastructure] Offline flash logging — extract reusable standard
**Resolution:** Created `core/offline-logger/sensor_logger.h` — generic template header with `sensor_log_*` function prefix (adapt by renaming to `<name>_log_*` and updating the log file path). Added "Offline Flash Logging" section to `JCTsh-Property-Sensor-Pattern.md` with template adaptation instructions, on_boot mount snippet, on_connect replay block (500ms settle delay), and interval guard (connected → publish, offline → log_write). Removed CARD-016 from pattern doc Open Gaps. 2026-06-14.

---

### CARD-015 · [enhancement] [front-porch-temp-sensor] Environmental data pipeline integration
**Resolution:** Added SNTP, humidity/pressure IDs, and 5-min `/data` publish to firmware (temp, humidity, pressure, illuminance, lat/lon H8, rssi, ISO 8601 UTC). Added `illuminance_lx` to the environmental data schema and Apps Script. Node-RED wildcard caught it automatically — no flow changes. OTA flashed 2026-06-14.

---

### CARD-007 · [idea] [hiking-sensor] Hiking observations pipeline (Tasker → Sheets)
**Resolution:** Tasker widget → Android speech recognition → HTTP POST to Apps Script → Hiking Observations sheet with automatic category classification. No keyword prefix — widget tap is the intent signal. Steps 23–26 complete 2026-06-13.

---

### CARD-001 · [bug] [garage-radar] Garage-radar false presence on door close
**Resolution:** Ill-defined and no longer applicable — closed.
